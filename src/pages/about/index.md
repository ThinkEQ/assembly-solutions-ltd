subtitle: ASL is a family run, sub-contract manufacturer based in Bolton
intro: >-
  In October 2020 we celebrated 25 years in business. This anniversary followed
  another big milestone where Founder Graham Balshaw passed ASL down to his
  three children, Gareth, Sophie and Oliver.


  Family values are not just words, they're a real thing that you can see when walking around the factory. We work together as a team, sharing the same vision, values and goals.

We run a really efficient operation. Every production line is streamlined for fast manufacture, so that we can deliver products in the quickest possible time.

Customers buy from us because we boast an extensive range of high speed machines that cut, strip and terminate wires in seconds, which makes us the fastest turnaround manufacturer in the market.

You'll see that we enjoy what we do, and we thrive off the challenges that new projects give us. We're focused on speed, but we don't rush. Every product is made to exact specification and 100% electrically tested.
