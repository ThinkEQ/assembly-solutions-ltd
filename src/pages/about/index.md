  In October 2020 we celebrated 25 years in business. This anniversary followed
  another big milestone where Founder Graham Balshaw passed ASL down to his
  three children, Gareth, Sophie and Oliver.


  Family values are not just words, they're a real thing that you can see when walking around the factory. We work together as a team, sharing the same vision, values and goals.
