testimonial:
  quote: "\"ASL is without a doubt the best UK manufacturer of wiring looms and
    wiring harnesses. They have been our preferred supplier for 10 years because
    their quality and attention to details is none other than excellent, and
    they deliver when they say they will - which is something my other suppliers
    don't do! For us we find working with ASL extremely easy, they are always
    quick to respond and support us with fast turnaround deliveries when we have
    urgent demands\""
