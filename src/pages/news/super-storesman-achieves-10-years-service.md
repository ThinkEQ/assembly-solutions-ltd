        We are celebrating our Super Storesman **Kevin Westfield** for reaching
        an incredible 10 Years of Service at Assembly Solutions. 


        Kevin joined back in 2012 through an agency as a Warehouse Assistant, and over his ten years, he has worked his way up and gained a vast amount of knowledge and experience by working in multiple departments including Purchasing and Accounts. He eventually found his way back to his happy place which was the Warehouse! Kevin is now the Warehouse Supervisor and is responsible for all goods coming in and out of the factory.


        Kevin is an employee who everybody loves, his huge smile and contagious happy energy makes him a man we all enjoy to be around.

      quote: Reaching this milestone is a privilege and honour. Looking at the current
        world climate today and seeing the challenges that many people face, I
        feel extremely fortunate to be part of a thriving growing company and a
        team that pulls together like one big family. I've thoroughly enjoyed
        all 10 ten years and want to express great gratitude for the career
        opportunities the company has given me. The Management Team are
        excellent at driving the direction of the company, ensuring we achieve
        record-breaking results year on year which creates job security and
        investment opportunities to continually improve the facilities to give
        employees a better place to work, which the company owners are very
        passionate about. I'm excited for the many more years ahead, progressing
        within my role and to see ASL grow even further!
