        ##  **What is a control panel?**


        <!--StartFragment-->


        In simple terms, an [electrical control panel](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/electrical-control-panels) is a metal panel or enclosure that contains a combination of electrical devices. These devices monitor and control equipment using electrical power and send signals to direct the operation of machines or equipment.  


        Within a basic control panel there are a few main components:


        * The main circuit breaker - where all the power comes into the panel from various devices.

        * The surge arrestor - protects the panel from electrical surges such as a lightning strike. 

        * The transformer - switches the power down in order to supply smaller devices.

        * The terminal block -  a modular block that connects devices and joins two or more wires together. 


         Control panels can be configured very simply or can be extremely complex to meet the needs of different industrial environments.

        ## **What do control panels do?**


        <!--EndFragment-->


        <!--StartFragment-->


        Behind the scenes of every factory, there are lots of control panels that drive the process and keep it working efficiently. Factories use control panels to operate functions like production lines or conveyor equipment. 


        As more companies move towards automation and robotics, the control panel plays a pivotal role in controlling the entire manufacturing process. A well designed control panel will reduce downtime, increase productivity and protect vital equipment. 


        You can find control panels in the dashboard of motor vehicles, ships and aircraft. The panels are used to monitor and gauge information such as speed and distance. They also operate essential systems like motor control, navigation and autopilot. 


        But it’s not just factories and vehicles that use control panels. Organisations around the globe rely on control panels for many daily processes. From mainframe computers to security systems or life saving medical equipment.

        ##  **Industries that use control panels**


        <!--EndFragment-->


        <!--StartFragment-->


        Control panels are used in all walks of life and are found across [a vast range of industries](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/industries) including automotive, utility, agriculture, security and leisure. Most of these industries will use bespoke control panels designed and manufactured by a specialist team. 


        ###  The Automotive Industry 


        [The automotive industry](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/automotive-control-panel) is experiencing a green revolution with the electrification of vehicles from buses and trucks, to agricultural equipment. To meet the demands of this changing technology, businesses require innovative control panels that facilitate the development of their products and services as they adapt and grow. 


        At Assembly Solutions, we are proud to work with Alexander Dennis, a global leader in the design and manufacture of double deck buses. For over 10 years we have developed and fabricated a range of control panels alongside their other [electric products](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/). 


        [Read more about our projects with Alexander Dennis](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/projects/alexander-dennis/) and why they consider us to be the UK’s best control panel manufacturer. 


        ###  The Nuclear Industry 


        The nuclear industry uses control panels to detect and monitor plant activity. The control room in a nuclear power station contains a combination of complex panels and boards. This equipment is safety-critical and control panels must be 100% reliable. 


        To design, manufacture and build control panels for the nuclear industry requires a wealth of knowledge and experience. The panels are more complex and technical than in other sectors and are made by a [team of specialist panel builders](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/control-panels). 


        **\

        ## **How control panels are made**


        <!--EndFragment-->


        <!--StartFragment-->


        Control panel development begins at the design stage where the manufacturer works closely with the customer to understand their ideas and develop a fitting design. The panels are manufactured in a state of the art facility using quality panel wiring alongside computer-aided design. Each panel is tested and quality approved before the final installation. 


        At Assembly Solutions, our engineers carry out on-site visits to discuss your project and develop the most cost-effective solution for your business. Our team offers a flexible service and fast turnaround times on all of our panel builds.
