        It was a special day and proud moment for me to promote Gareth to Sales
        & Commercial Director. I have been lucky enough to work alongside Gareth
        for over 15 years and have seen him take on multiple roles,
        demonstrating his work ethic and loyalty. This well-deserved title makes
        Gareth the first non-family member to become a Director, and it is a
        pleasure to see him achieve this recognition for all his great work
        contributed to ASL. He has helped the company grow by £1million in the
        last 12 months and I am looking forward to seeing him create even more
        success for himself personally and for the company.
