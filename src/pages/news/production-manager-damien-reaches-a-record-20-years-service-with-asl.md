    Proud of his achievement, Damien says “It has been a fantastic journey over
    the last 20 years, not only for my personal development but to be part of a
    company that has grown and developed into one of the UK’s leading wiring
    manufacturers. Whilst my hard work and dedication has been key to the growth
    of ASL over the last 20 years, I have to pay tribute to the wonderful team I

        * Celebrating 20 Years at ASL

        * Record for longest serving employee

        * Damien pays tribute to wonderful team


        ### Celebrating 20 Years


        Damien has been crowned with the record of 20 Years at ASL after joining ASL in 1995 as a

        wiring loom assembly operator!


        Since joining the company, Damien took to the day to day challenges like a duck to water. He

        enjoyed getting stuck into production and loved learning all about quality processes and how to make the cells run more efficient. Very quickly Damien worked his way up from assembly

        operator, to production supervisor, to now a senior production manager for all wiring harnesses.


        Damien is the only person in the company who has reached 20 years’ service so he also holds

        the tremendous title of being ASL’s longest serving employee!


        ### Founder, Graham is delighted to see Damien reach 20 years


        "Damien has done an outstanding job for the company since I signed him up all those years ago.


        He was only a young teenager when he joined, but I could instantly see that he was a bright and capable individual who I needed on my team. It has been great watching Damien develop into a successful senior manager, and he has grown great respect from myself, and everyone within the company”.
