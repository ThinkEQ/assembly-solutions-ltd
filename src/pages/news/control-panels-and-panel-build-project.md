        Control Panel Manufacture and Panel Building is a specialist service
        that we have been supplying for over 10 years.


        It is a product that we only took into production after a customer visited our factory, and whilst walking around commented "Do you think you could make our control panels as well as [cable assemblies](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/cable-assemblies)?"


        Of course the answer was, yes! When a customer asks for something, even if it is slightly out of our expertise, we always find a way to do it. And from that moment on, the [control panel](www.assembly-solutions.com/electrical-control-panels) journey began.


        Over the last 10 years, we have grown rapidly in this product range and manufactured all types of small and large custom-designed panels, to markets including; Automotive, Nuclear and Utilities.


        Today we are excited to finishing our latest batch of x100 control panels which will be installed into Cash In Transit Vehicles.


        A special shout out to Joao (pictured above), who has done an awesome job completing these panels and all within the customers demanding deadline!
