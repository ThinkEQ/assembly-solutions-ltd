        [Wire preparation](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/wire-preparation)
        is an essential step when assembling wires, to ensure they will be
        functional, efficient and safe once installed. As one of our core
        services, we at Assembly Solutions know all about proper wire
        preparation, and pride ourselves on being industry leaders in this
        regard.


        In this article, we will share expert information from our team about wire preparation, the steps involved in the wire prep process, and how to find a suitable wire preparation service that will deliver a quality product.


        ## What is Wire Preparation?


        Wire preparation is the process of readying a wire or cable, so that a connector can be attached. Manufacturers will often have specific requirements when it comes to wire preparation, depending on their intended purpose. Wires must be prepared by experienced individuals or professionals, to ensure that the connections are both functional and safe.


        ## When is Wire Preparation used?


        Wire preparation is an essential step in the process of wire manufacture. Once the metal core of the wire has been ground, heated, and the proper insulation applied to contain the current and protect users, it can be then be prepared for connection. 


        Wire preparation is practiced at all levels – from DIY projects, to mass-scale manufacture. It is key to both the safety and functionality of whichever product or machine the wire will be used to power. 


        ## 10 Steps of the Wire Preparation Process


        The ten steps to the wire preparation process are as follows:


        1. Cut the wire to the required length.


        2. Measure how much of the insulated jacket will need to be stripped.


        3. Mark a line on the jacket to act as a guide.


        4. Slice through the jacket along the mark.


        5. Strip the end of the wire, either with a handheld tool or purpose-built machine.


        6. Arrange the stripped end alongside the connector you intend to use.


        7. Terminate the wire by soldering or crimping.


        8. Repeat steps 2-7 on the other end of the wire if needed.


        9. Examine the length of the wire for any damage to the insulated jacket.


        10. Test the wire in a controlled manner before using it for any projects.


        These steps of the wire preparation process are intended for small-scale and DIY projects. However, if you require a number of wires to be prepared at once, we would recommend employing a wire preparation service that can guarantee quality, as well as a high quantity of prepared wires.


        ## Wire Preparation Tools


        Wire preparation tools can vary in terms of their power and capacity to prepare multiple wires at once. Even a standard, household pair of wire strippers can be considered a wire preparation tool. However, in the manufacturing world, wire preparation tools are often much more complex and must be operated by trained professionals or engineers.


        At Assembly Solutions, we employ a number of different tools and machines in our wire preparation process. With a variety of purpose-built devices and apparatus at our disposal, we are able to meet the needs of customers from a wide range of industries, and pride ourselves on delivering an industry-leading wire prep service.
