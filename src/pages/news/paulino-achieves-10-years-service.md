        **Production Pro Paulino Achieves 10 Years Service**


        Congratulations to our Production Pro, Paulino, for 10 Years at ASL!


        Today we are celebrating our control panel king for reaching the magnificent milestone of 10 Years Service.\

        \

        Since moving from Portugal to the UK, Paulino very quickly became a strong part of the ASL family - a quality-driven team leader and super skilled at making control panels and wiring harnesses.\

        \

        In fact, he was so efficient at making wiring harnesses, we asked if we could clone him. True story: 12 months later, his identical twin brother flew over and joined ASL too!\

        \

        This morning we gave an uplifting presentation, gifting Paulino with a Â£250 Amazon voucher, box full of Budweisers, bottle of red wine and a card signed by everyone.\

        \

        Wï»¿e have also all enjoyed a Carrs Pasties lunch (with peas & cabbage)!\

        \

        Rewarding your people for their service is so important, and I think the extra cost to celebrate as a company is 100% worth it.\

        \

        This is how a family business does it! ðŸ’™
