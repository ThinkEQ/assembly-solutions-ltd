        **ASL Champions - Celebrating Staff Milestones**


        The loyalty and level of commitment from our team is absolutely outstanding and so high that we have created a feature wall representing staff who have reached 10 Years (or more) service.


        We are always looking at way to continually improve our culture and when reflecting on how we celebrate a staff milestone, we had the idea to dedicate a wall to those who had served 10 years or more.


        When a staff member reaches the 10 Year Milestone, they are gifted with a voucher, bottle of bubbly and chocolate hamper. We also get a Domino's Delivery or Carrs Pasties Delivery at dinner time on the day, for all the team to enjoy - this goes down a treat!
