        **Investing in Staff Training for Continuous Quality**


        What happens if you invest in your employees and then they leave?\

        What happens if you don't, and they stay?


        Investing in staff training is a top priority at Assembly Solutions as we continually push for higher quality standards and to give employees confidence in all their work.


        We are currently providing training to a selection of new starters who have joined our [Cable Assembly](www.assembly-solutions.com/cable-assembly) department after significant growth in this product area. We have recruited 5 new production operators to support the work load, and over the next 4 weeks they will learn the skills of how to manufacture [custom cable assemblies](www.assembly-solutions.com/cable-assemblies) and understand the standards that every product must be made to.


        A lot of our training is done in-house by our qualified and well experienced cable assembly Technicians. By training in-house, we can work with real projects that are passing through production. Showing staff how a cable assembly is made starts right at the beginning with the CAD drawing, specification, wire list, parts list and work instructions which are all custom created by our Engineering Team.


        **Benefits of Cable Assembly Training** 


        * Increases Efficiency

        * Improves Productivity

        * Improves Staff Confidence

        * More Accountability

        * Less Support Required

        * An Established Standard for Trained Members of Staff

        * Opportunities for Employee Development by tracking Personal Growth


        Today our new Production Operator Alex (left) is being trained Daryl on how to make Custom Mains Power Cables. These cables are for the Food & Catering Industry, to be used in Heated Food Serving Units.


        Daryl is teaching Alex about crimping and the correct application of Ferrule/Core End Terminals. He will learn how to use crimp tools, how to crimp to IPC 620 standards including crimping techniques, and how to identify an incorrectly crimped terminal.
