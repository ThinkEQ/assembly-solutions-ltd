        **New Deal: ASL Win Control Panel Project**


        We are delighted to share the news that we have landed a lucrative new contract to manufacture 50 control panels for use in specialist vehicle conversions.\

        \

        Production is flowing in full force at our Bolton factory today, and the collaboration between colleagues has never looked so good! Our skilled operators are hard at work with some demanding delivery dates to hit, but all parts are in (miracle!) and things are moving at a positive pace.\

        \

        Huge well done to our Production ManagerÂ Phil Beales & his team for getting operations efficiently up and running, and also our Technical Manager Damien Walsh whose expertise has been significant to pull this project off successfully.\

        \

        What a time to be part of uk manufacturing.
