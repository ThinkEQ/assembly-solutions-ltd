        **Production Manager Reaches 20 Years Service**


        Wow, 20 Years Service.


        We are absolutely thrilled to be celebrating this momentous occasion with our Production Manager Rob Parkinson after he has achieved 20 Years Service at ASL.


        When Rob first started as a production operator, little did we know that he would one day become the Production Manager he is today. We remember him as a fresh-faced teenager, eager and enthusiastic who was always keen to learn and grow.


        We have watched Rob excel in his role and take on new responsibilities with confidence and determination. He has always been a great team player and has never hesitated to roll up his sleeves and get his hands dirty to get the job done.


        He has been a true asset to the company and we are lucky to have him on board. He has come a long way since his days as a production operator, and we are proud of the person he has become.


        Rob has been fundamental in the growth of the business and has played a key role to generate sales which is currently at a record Â£7million per annum!
