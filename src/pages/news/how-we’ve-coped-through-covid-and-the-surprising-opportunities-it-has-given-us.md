        **Coping through Coronavirus**


        When the Coronavirus pandemic struck us all last year, it was without a doubt the most uncertain and worrying time for a lot of businesses.


        On Monday 16th March 2020, we were instructed to "Stay at Home" if you could work from home. The following morning we called all managers into an urgent meeting and discussed what we needed to do to start following the new government guidelines.


        Probably like most businesses, we weren't equipped or prepared for this change. We quickly recognised that we needed to invest £10,000 in new laptops for all those who would have to start working from home. This was a cost we hadn't budgeted for in the year, but we had no other option but to go ahead. Our IT Support did a super job getting the laptops arranged and we're thankful to our office staff, who all made the "work from home" transition very smooth and stress-free. 


        #### **The Surprising Opportunity**


        It was around April time that this Coronavirus pandemic was starting to look very serious and we were worried that it was about to affect our customers and therefore our business. Did we need to start putting a plan together on how we survive through this, keeping all our team in a job and still be able to pay bills and wages? It was the most worrying time we have ever faced.


        Then very much to our surprise on April 20th we received the biggest opportunity we have ever been given, a cable assembly contract worth £700,000. This would not only guarantee to keep all our team in a job, but we would actually have to recruit an additional 20 production operators! We jumped at the chance and did everything we could to offer the most competitive prices and the fastest turnaround as delivery was critical. This UK customer was under pressure and required the services of a UK supplier after experiencing delays on cable assembly deliveries from it's Indian factory which during a period was closed due to the coronavirus outbreak.


        Two weeks from receiving the enquiry, we received the incredible news that we had won the contract - we were absolutely delighted! With no time to celebrate (well, all the pubs were shut anyway!) we got started on setting up production lines, training the team, recruiting more staff and getting all technical documentation in order. A big part of winning this work was to prove we could meet the urgent delivery schedule and we could do with our fast and flexible capability to create new production lines at very short notice, utilising our space shop floor capacity, resource in equipment.


        It was an exciting and extremely busy time from May to November fulfilling the contract - our factory had never been filled with so much energy and team were on their A game to make it a success. Every department and individual pulled together like clock work to make sure every part was made to exact specification and highest quality and to ensure every delivery date was met. We had a couple of bumps along the way with delays on tooling and shortages on free issue material, but overall the project was a huge success and importantly the customer was thrilled with our performance throughout.


        This contract has contributed to an incredible record growth in sales of £1.2million.


        #### **Supporting the NHS & Medical Industry**


        We have supplied the medical industry for over 20 years with various electrical [cable assemblies](/cable-assemblies) and [wiring looms](/wiring-loom) for apparatus and equipment. Since the outbreak of Coronavirus, we have been proud to support Medical manufacturers with urgent orders after they saw a rapid increase in demand. 


        Our wire and cable assemblies have been manufactured with care and delivered to equipment in hospitals all over the world.


        * Cables for Covid Testing Apparatus

        * Hospital Bed Cable Assemblies

        * Sterilisation Equipment Cables

        * Ventilation Equipment Cables


        Whilst it has been fantastic keeping our factory busy with medical demand and opportunities, we have certainly felt the pain for a handful of our customers who are in suffering industries, especially those in Aviation and Hospitality. 


        Our team have been absolutely unbelievable throughout this very difficult year, and have pulled together in a way which is absolutely admirable. Every single person has supported all the changes we've made, and really risen to the challenge during this rapid growth. 


        We hope all our customers and suppliers are getting through this challenging time and if there is anything we can do to help, please get in touch.
