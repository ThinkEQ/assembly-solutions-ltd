        * Sales growth of 1 MILLION including supporting Medical Sector

        * £25,000 investment to adapt to stay at home government guideline

        * Biggest ever single purchase order £700,000


        \

        When COVID-19 struck us all last year, it was without a doubt the most uncertain and worrying time for a lot of businesses.\

        \

        On Monday 16th March 2020, we were instructed to “Stay at Home” if you could work from home. The following morning we called all managers into an urgent meeting, to discuss what we needed to do, to follow this new government guideline.\

        \

        Probably like most businesses, we weren’t equipped or prepared for this change. We quickly recognised that we needed to invest £10,000 in new laptops for all those who would have to start working from home. This was a cost we hadn’t budged for in the year, but we had no other option but to go ahead. Our IT support did a super job getting the laptops arranged and we’re thankful to our office staff, who all made the “work from home” transition very smooth and stress-free.\

        \

        In April we received a huge opportunity which very much came to us as a surprise, and contributed towards a record growth in sales of £1Million. The enquiry came from a UK company who have a manufacturing plant in India but due to the pandemic, they had to close their Indian factory. We were approached with this very urgent demand, but with the size of our factory and the available floor space, we had the ability to set up production cells in a very short space of time. Proving we had spare capacity, equipment and resource to utilise at such short notice, we won our biggest ever contract worth £700,000. \

        \

        We had to recruit 20 new members of staff and it’s with thanks to our local agency that supported us, by providing a team of skilled production operators that we had fully trained up in a matter of weeks. The contract lasted 6 months and apart from some long lead times on tooling, overall the project was a big success. \

        \

        During last year we also supported the Medical sector by suppling manufacturers with electrical wire and cable assemblies that are being used in coronavirus testing equipment, ventilation apparatus and hospital beds.\

        \

        Sadly we have seen some customers suffer, especially those who have been badly affected in the Aviation and Hospitality industry. This in turn has had an impact on us, and is why we are evermore grateful for the new opportunities we’ve been given.\

        \

        Our staff have been unbelievable through all of this, and have pulled together in a way which is absolutely admirable. Every single person has supported all the changes we’ve made, and really risen to the challenges during this rapid growth.\

        \

        We hope all our customers and suppliers are getting through this challenging time and if there is anything we can do to help, please get in touch.\
