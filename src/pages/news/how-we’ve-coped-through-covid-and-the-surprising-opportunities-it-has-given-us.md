        **Coping through Coronavirus**


        When COVID-19 struck us all last year, it was without a doubt the most uncertain and worrying time for a lot of businesses.


        On Monday 16th March 2020, we were instructed to "Stay at Home" if you could work from home. The following morning we called all managers into an urgent meeting and discussed what we needed to do to start following the new government guidelines.


        Probably like most businesses, we weren't equipped or prepared for this change. We quickly recognised that we needed to invest £10,000 in new laptops for all those who would have to start working from home. This was a cost we hadn't budgeted for in the year, but we had no other option but to go ahead. Our IT Support did a super job getting the laptops arranged and we're thankful to our office staff, who all made the "work from home" transition very smooth and stress-free. 


        **The Surprising Opportunity**


        In April we received a huge opportunity which very much came to us as a surprise, and contributed towards a record growth in sales of £1million. The enquiry came from a UK company who have a manufacturing plant in India but due to the pandemic had to close their Indian factory.


        We were approached with this very urgent demand and with the size of our factory and the available floor space, we had the ability to set up a production cells in a very short space of time. Proving we had spare capacity, equipment and resource to utilise at such short notice, we won our biggest ever contract worth £700,000.


        We had to recruit 20 new members of staff and it's with thanks to our local agency that supported us, by providing a team of skilled production operators that we had fully trained up in a matter of weeks. The contract lasted 6 months and apart from some long lead times on tooling, overall the project was a big success.


        **Supporting the Medical Industry**


        We have supplied the medical industry for over 20 years with various electrical [cable assemblies](/cable-assemblies) and [wiring looms](/wiring-loom) for apparatus and equipment. 


        Since the outbreak of Coronavirus, we have been proud to support Medical manufacturers with urgent orders after they saw a rapid increase in demand. 


        Our wire and cable assemblies have been manufactured with care and delivered to equipment in hospitals all over the world.


        * Cables for Covid Testing Apparatus

        * Hospital Bed Cable Assemblies

        * Sterilisation Equipment Cables

        * Ventilation Equipment Cables


        Whilst it has been fantastic keeping our factory busy with medical demand and opportunities, we have certainly felt the pain for a handful of our customers who are in suffering industries, especially those in Aviation and Hospitality. 


        Our team have been absolutely unbelievable throughout this very difficult year, and have pulled together in a way which is absolutely admirable. Every single person has supported all the changes we've made, and really risen to the challenge during this rapid growth. 


        We hope all our customers and suppliers are getting through this challenging time and if there is anything we can do to help, please get in touch.
