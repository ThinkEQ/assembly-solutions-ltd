        We are celebrating 25 years in business, after our Founder Graham
        Balshaw had the passion to set up an electrical manufacturing company,
        back in October 1995.\

        \

        Graham created ASL aged 35, after he gained many years of experience in senior management levels at two big electrical companies; Philips and Meggitt.\

        \

        Since starting ASL, we’ve been proud to see it grow steadily into a successful sub-contract manufacturer that today employs over 60 staff and supplies to the likes of Ford, Rolls Royce and Siemens.

    testimonial:
      quote: >-
        It has been an incredible journey, and one I look back on with great
        pride. The early years were extremely hard and required long hours into
        the night. I couldn’t have done it without the support of my wife Anne
        who raised the children which enabled me to focus on getting ASL off the
        ground. 


        The tough days were worth it and it’s thanks to the loyalty of the staff, that ASL made it this far. After recently passing the company down to my three children, I’m now looking forward to seeing them take things to the next level.
      name: Graham Balshaw, Founder and Chairman
