        We Have Successfully Achieved ISO 45001 - The International Standard for
        Occupational Health & Safety Management.\

        \

        It has been an exciting 12 months after we set off on the challenge to achieve the exceptionally high Health & Safety standards of ISO 45001, and we are happy to announce that we have done it!


        The implementation and certification of our ISO 45001 Safety Management System took around 6 months to complete. Initially, our external health and safety advisor carried out a gap analysis of our existing safety management processes compared to the requirements of the ISO 45001 standard. This identified where we needed to implement new procedures or processes. Our health and safety advisor then prepared an integrated management system that encompassed our existing ISO 9001 quality process and procedures.


        Our approach to the Safety Management System was risk based and the senior management team worked with our safety advisor to better understand our organisation, context and the internal and external issues that could influence our Safety Management System. From this we identified any interested parties and considered their needs and expectations and deciding upon the scope of the Safety Management System.


        Our senior management team were committed to the process and worked with our safety advisor to develop the health and safety policy and objectives ensuring they were aligned to the strategic direction of ASL. As part of the process we fully engaged with our workforce ensuring that everyone received ISO awareness training ensured the workforce were represented at our health and safety committee meetings and are also part of the Safety Leadership Team.


        After full implementation of the ISO 45001 Safety Management System we carried out our internal audits and a management review meeting ready for our certification audit. Our certification audit went well and we successfully passed the audit without any non conformances being raised. 


        Health and Safety continues to be a priority within our business and we are committed to maintaining a safe working environment and continual improvement.


        Our ISO 45001 Safety Management System will help with building trust and brand integrity by providing an assurance that ASL’s management system meets the requirements of the international standard and will improve our operational performance.


        Over the last 12 months we have rapidly grown and recruited an extra 20 staff. This incredible growth led us to look at how we can ensure that as growth continues, our accidents don't and our safety culture continually improves. Having ISO45001 standards in place ensures all employees feel they are working in a safe environment.\

        As a manufacturer of [Cable Assemblies](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/cable-assemblies), [Wiring Looms](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/wiring-loom) and [Control Panels](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/control-panels), there are many processes involved in making the products which employees need to feel safe. All processes carried out on the factory floor have undergone safety risk assessments to ensure accidents are kept to an absolute minimum. These processes include; Hot Works and manual handling, inclusive of moving heavy cable drums and [control boxes](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/electrical-control-panels).


        To implement ISO 45001 has cost the company £10,000 which is a substantial investment but it is absolutely essential as we strive forward in maintaining our position as the industry leader for [quality cable assembly](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/cable-assembly) services and [wiring harness manufacture](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/wiring-harness) services.\

        Achieving this accreditation is only the beginning of how we prioritise the safety and wellbeing for our workforce and customers. We look forward to the maintaining and continual improvement these new standards and exploring even more ways to become better in these crucial areas.\

      quote: We have always taken Health & Safety seriously but without the official
        certification our efforts were going unnoticed. Now we have the ISO45001
        certification, we are also being considered for large tenders by blue
        chip companies who (in many cases) require their suppliers to have this
        accreditation. It has also really benefited our staff as they all now
        have a better understanding of why Health & Safety is so important
        around the factory
