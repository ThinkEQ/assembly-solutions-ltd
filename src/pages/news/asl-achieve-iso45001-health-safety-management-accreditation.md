        We Have Successfully Achieved ISO45001 - The Industry Recognised
        Accreditation for Occupational Health & Safety Management.\

        \

        It has been an exciting 12 months after we set off on the challenge to achieve the exceptionally high Health & Safety standards of ISO45001, and we are happy to announce that we have done it!\

        \

        The processes to pass this incredibly important accreditation involved implementing;


        1. Creating new risk assessments

        2. Carrying out health & safety committee meetings

        3. Involving whole workforce in changes to help reduce number of accidents


        This ISO 45001 Certification has been integrated into with our “ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System Certification” which now forms our new "Implemented Management System".\

        \

        Over the last 12 months we have rapidly grown and recruited an extra 20 staff. This incredible growth led us to look at how we can ensure that as growth continues, but that our accidents don't. Having ISO45001 standards in place all around our factory will ensure all employees feel they are in a safe working environment.\

        \

        As a manufacturer of [Cable Assemblies](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/cable-assemblies), [Wiring Looms](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/wiring-loom) and [Control Panels](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/control-panels), there are many processes involved in making the products which employees need to feel safe.


        All processes carried out on the factory floor have undergone safety risk assessments to ensure accidents are kept at an absolute minimum. These processes include; Soldering, Heat Guns, and moving heavy cable drums.


        To gain ISO45001, an external auditor was on site for four days and went through our Integrated Management System thoroughly with the team. It involved participation from production staff answering questions to show their H&S knowledge.


        There are many benefits to our company now that we are following the ISO 45001 Framework. Here are a few;


        * We now involve all production and office staff with Continuous Improvement Projects which has led to full day workshops improving their knowledge on Health & Safety matters.

        * It has increased our awareness of Health & Safety, where all employees better understand the risks and ensure that workers take an active role in health and safety matters.

        * Our reputation is enhanced with this international benchmark and we are now able to bid for new opportunities where they require this accreditation.

        * Reduced absenteeism is expected by better managing the H&S risks in the workplace, we will be able to protect employees, reducing absenteeism and turnover rates.

        * Reduced Insurance Premiums – By demonstrating that you have an effective occupational health and safety management system in place, many businesses can go on to benefit from reduced insurance premiums.

        * Improve Management of H&S Compliance Issues – ISO 45001 helps to improve your ability to respond to regulatory compliance issues, reducing the overall costs of incidents and downtime.

        * Better Manage Health and Safety Risks – the standard will help you to determine hazards and the health and safety risks associated with your activities; seeking to either eliminate them or put controls in place to minimise their effects.

        To implement ISO 45001 has cost the company £10,000 which is a substantial investment but it is absolutely essential as we strive forward in becoming the industry leader for [quality cable assembly](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/cable-assembly) services and [wiring harness manufacture](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/wiring-harness) services.\

        \

        Achieving this accreditation is only the beginning of how we prioritise the safety and wellbeing for our workforce, and we look forward to the maintaining these new standards and exploring even more ways to become better in these crucial areas.\

        A special shout out and thanks to our Health & Safety Advisor Tony Lundy who has done an exceptional job implementing the new IMS and helping us obtain ISO 45001.

      quote: We have always taken Health & Safety seriously but without the official
        certification our efforts were going unnoticed. Now we have the ISO45001
        certification, we are also being considered for large tenders by blue
        chip companies who (in many cases) require their suppliers to have this
        accreditation. It has also really benefited our staff as they all now
        have a better understanding of why Health & Safety is so important
        around the factory
