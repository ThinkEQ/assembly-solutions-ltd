        ## What’s the Difference: Wiring Harnesses & Cable Assembly


        With a variety of different types of electrical connectors, harnesses and assemblies, it can be difficult to differentiate between them all. We’ve decided to create a guide to help explain the difference between wiring harnesses and cable assemblies.


        It’s important to clarify the differences between wire and cables in order to fully understand the variations of [wiring harnesses](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/wiring-harness) and cable assemblies. A wire is basically a single conductor made up of either single or multiple strands of connective materials. These materials, typically copper or aluminium, are protected in a non-conductive thermoplastic. 


        However, a cable is a collection of gathered wires that are often covered in different coloured thermoplastic sheaths to aid identification. These sheaths are secured together within a rubber or thermoplastic external cover.


        ## Wiring Harnesses Explained 


        A [wiring harness](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/wiring-harness) is used as a method of keeping many wires tidy and follows a predefined layout. An example of this would include several wires of a specific length, which are secured together in order to save space and prevent damage during use. Some more complex wiring harnesses have wires going in multiple directions and may include a variety of different termination components.  The wires in both simple and more complex harnesses are usually bound together. Keeping the wires neatly in place also helps to identify faults much easier. At Assembly Solutions, the production of multiple wire harnesses can be done at once, they are made quickly and at a affordable costs.


        There a huge benefits of outsourcing wire harness production, for example, from Assembly Solutions. For one, there are significantly reduced costs both in terms of direct labour and capital spend. There is also greater efficiencies that are achieved by using a company like Assembly Solutions for wiring harness production. At Assembly Solutions, we supply great quality and safety assured wiring harnesses for a wide variety of industries.  Using a wiring harness producer, like Assembly Solutions, offer a superior quality finish and incorporate quality assurance procedures to reduce the risk of faults in the completed products.


        ## What is a Cable Assembly? 


        A [cable assembly](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/cable-assembly) is very similar to a wiring harness. This is because both types follow a pre-designed layout that holds several wires together. However, cable assemblies have the ability to incorporate and hold together individual wires and multicore cables. The biggest difference between cable assemblies and wiring harnesses is that with cable assembly the wiring system is protected by an external casing. Usually made from rubber or vinyl in order to protect the wires and cables from extreme weather, chemical substances and physical damage.   


        Similar to wiring harnesses, the main benefit of the outsourcing cable assembly is that costs are kept low and greater quality assurance for products. 


        ## What is a Wiring Loom? 


        Wiring looms, often referred to as [cable loom](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/cable-looms) or electrical loom, are more complex assemblies that are made from different wires and cables. Wiring looms typically have different components, terminations and more intricate layouts when compared with wiring harnesses or [cable assemblies](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/cable-assemblies).  


        Wiring looms are designed to be more cost-efficient and reduce material wastage. Wiring looms are effective space-saving solutions as they minimise the wiring footprint of a product. They can also be used for partial or complete drop-in solutions making them perfect for applications such as aircraft, household appliances or motor vehicles. Because of this, wiring looms are great at reducing installation times, costs and help to improve overall efficiency. 


        Wiring looms also have the ability to be safety checked before the loom is installed, helping to reduce wiring failures and costly rebuilds.
