        **New Deal: £250,000 Cable Assembly Contract**\

        \

        W﻿e are excited to share we have secured a new contract to manufacture 12,000 cable assemblies for underground leak detection devices.\

        \

        Our Bolton factory is busy at work with 7 full-time production operators in this cell, all doing a smashing job and successfully meeting the customers demanding delivery dates!\

        \

        A special shout-out to Wayne, our super Solder King! He has been a key player producing these high quality cables with his incredible soldering skills and training new staff.\

        \

        This deal actually comes from our biggest new customer this year so it’s a special one, and I’m happy to hear sales are now forecasting annual orders of up to £500,000!\

        \

        If you’re wondering how we attracted such a significant new customer that helped ASL achieve a record year, scroll to the end.\

        \

        This is why I’m so grateful for your support! 👏
