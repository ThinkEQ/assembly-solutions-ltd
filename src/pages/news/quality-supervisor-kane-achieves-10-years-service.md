        We are celebrating our Quality Supervisor **Kane Mellett** for reaching
        an incredible 10 Years of Service at Assembly Solutions. 


        Kane joined back in 2012 through an agency as a Warehouse Assistant, and over his ten years, he has worked his way up and gained a vast amount of knowledge and experience by working in multiple departments including Purchasing and Accounts. He eventually found his way back to his happy place which was the Warehouse! Kevin is now the Warehouse Supervisor and is responsible for all goods coming in and out of the factory.


        Ka is an employee who everybody loves, his huge smile and contagious happy energy makes him a man we all enjoy to be around.

      name: Kane Mellett, Quality Supervisor
      quote: I have really enjoyed working at ASL for all these years and it has been
        great to see the company grow from a small team of 20 to now a strong &
        supportive team of 90. I canâ€™t thank the company enough for all the
        opportunities they have given me and knowing I always have their support
        for career progression, has really helped me grow within my role in the
        Quality department. We're currently re-structuring the Quality
        department so I'm excited to be a part of this, building and developing
        our processes to improve performance and increase efficiencies.
