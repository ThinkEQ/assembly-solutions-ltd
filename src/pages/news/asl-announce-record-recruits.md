        **We are delighted to announce a record number of recruits over summer
        after signing up an additional 15 people.**


        Despite the economic challenges and the shrinking labour pool that hasn’t been helped by Brexit, Assembly Solutions have seen an increase in UK manufacturing opportunities which has led to securing a number of significant cable assembly and wiring harness contracts.


        With 15 new starters joining over summer, the company has reached a record workforce of 90 full time staff. The new starters include 3 ambitious Apprentices; Alex Waterworth, Isobel Hargreaves and Jamie Preston, who are all striving to achieve senior roles in the Technical & Engineering department.


        The signing of new recruits shows no signs of slowing down, as we are still actively searching for new stars to fill roles in their Production & Quality department.


        It has been a busy period for the company after seeing a 20% growth in sales and we proud to continuing supplying  some world leading manufacturers including Ford, Siemens & Vodafone.
