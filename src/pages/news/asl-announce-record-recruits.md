        **We are delighted to announce we have boosted our team to a record of 90, after recruiting an additional 15 people this summer.**


        Despite the economic challenges and shrinking labour pool that hasn’t been helped by Brexit, we have seen a surprisingly big increase in UK manufacturing opportunities this year, and this has led us to securing a number of significant cable assembly and wiring harness contracts.


        The 15 new starters that joined over summer included 3 ambitious Apprentices; Alex Waterworth, Isobel Hargreaves & Jamie Preston, who are all striving for senior roles in the Technical & Engineering department. Since coming on board they have all had a positive affect and bring a passion that supports the companies culture, mission and vision.


        The signing of new recruits shows no signs of slowing down, as we are still actively searching for new stars to fill roles in our Production & Quality department.


        It has been a busy period for the company after seeing a 20% growth in sales and we're proud to continue supplying some of the worlds leading manufacturers; Ford, Siemens & Vodafone.
