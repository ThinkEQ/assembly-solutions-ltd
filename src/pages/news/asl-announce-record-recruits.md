        **HR Director, Sophie Balshaw of Bolton-based manufacturer Assembly
        Solutions Ltd has announced record number of recruits after signing up
        15 additional staff this summer.**


        The Cable Assembly company which supplies to world leading manufacturers including Ford, Siemens & Vodafone, has seen a 20% growth in sales and is forecasting a record year.


        Despite the economic challenges and the shrinking labour pool that hasn’t been helped by Brexit, Assembly Solutions have seen an increase in UK manufacturing opportunities which has led to them securing a number of significant cable assembly and wiring harness contracts.


        With 15 new starters joining over summer, the company has reached a record workforce of 90 full time staff. The new starters include 3 ambitious Apprentices; Alex Waterworth, Isobel Hargreaves and Jamie Preston, who are all striving to achieve senior roles in the Technical & Engineering department.


        The signing of new recruits shows no signs of slowing down, as the company are still actively searching for new stars to fill roles in their Production & Quality department.


        Sophie is a Co-Owner of Assembly Solutions, alongside her two brothers, Gareth & Oliver Balshaw, after the company was passed down by their father and Founder, Graham Balshaw in 2020.
