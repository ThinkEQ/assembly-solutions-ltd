        **Celebrating Damien for 25 Years Service**


        We are proud to celebrate a remarkable milestone at ASL - the first employee to achieve 25 years of service!


        Damien Walsh joined ASL in 1999 as a young production operator and, through dedication and expertise, has grown into his current role as a highly respected Technical Manager. Over the years, Damien has played a pivotal role in the company's success, contributing his extensive technical knowledge in electrical wiring and supporting ASL in securing numerous high-profile contracts, particularly in the automotive sector.


        Damien’s positive attitude, commitment to excellence, and wealth of industry expertise have made a lasting impact on both his colleagues and the company as a whole. In recognition of his outstanding service and loyalty, ASL has presented him with a £1,000 voucher, a Selfridges champagne hamper, a personalized glass trophy, and a card signed by the entire team.


        To further mark this special occasion, we also invited 49 Beans Coffee Company to provide coffee and cake for the entire ASL team a fitting tribute to Damien, a well-known coffee enthusiast.


        We extend our heartfelt congratulations to Damien for reaching this incredible milestone. His dedication over the past 25 years exemplifies the values and spirit of ASL, and we look forward to many more years of success together. 


        Congratulations Damien!
