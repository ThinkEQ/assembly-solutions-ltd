        **Celebrating a Special Milestone & New Ownership**


        Founder Graham Balshaw has passed the ownership of Assembly Solutions Ltd down to next generation, his three children; Gareth, Sophie and Oliver.


        After creating the cable assembly business 25 years ago in 1995, Father Graham is thrilled and beyond proud to be passing down what he started from his back bedroom, aged 35.


        "When I created the business 25 years ago, I never dreamt that Gareth, Sophie and Oliver would all join me one day, let alone enjoy it so much that they would eventually take over. It has been a blessing to see all three of them thrive in their positions and grow into such hard working and respectful professionals. With all their knowledge, ambition and passion, I can already see they're going to take ASL further than I could have ever imagined, and I will be the proudest father watching them. Whilst the actual running of the business is now completely down to Gareth, Sophie & Oliver, I plan on acting as Chairman for the next few years overseeing only the very top level information"\

        **Graham Balshaw, Founder & Chairman**


        “This is a special milestone for the family and one that myself, Sophie and Oliver are extremely grateful for. I've learnt a lot working alongside my father for 17 years and we share some great memories. One of my fondest memories was travelling to China visiting suppliers, this was a great trip and really opened my eyes to the opportunities with international business. Since then we have developed partnerships all over the world. I'm excited for this new chapter where we plan to double turnover to £10million"\

        **Gareth Balshaw, Managing Director**


        “It feels such a privilege to take on the role of ownership and we are certainly stepping into some very big shoes! Going through this process of taking over the company has been a really special time for us as a family. It's quite an emotional milestone, especially when you look back and see how far we have all come. We started off as kids helping dad out in the school holidays learning all about cables and wires, and here we are 20 years later taking over a £5Million turnover business! My dad has taught me so much over the years from mastering marketing techniques to understanding the overall operations of running a business. We plan to make him the proudest father alive”\

        **Sophie Balshaw, Marketing Director**


        “Electronics has been a part of my life since I was very young, I can still remember Dad teaching me how to wire my first plug when I was about 4 years old! It's because of him that I grew up with a passion for electronics and after going to University to study Electrical Engineering, joining Assembly Solutions was the future path I wanted to take. Taking over the business from dad has been such a great opportunity and one I feel extremely grateful for. He has built an incredible platform for us, and it's now time for us to push for everything we want to achieve!"\
