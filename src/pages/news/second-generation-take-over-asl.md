        **Celebrating a Special Milestone & New Ownership**


        Founder Graham Balshaw has passed the ownership of Assembly Solutions Ltd down to next generation, his three children; Gareth, Sophie and Oliver.


        After creating the cable assembly business 25 years ago in 1995, Father Graham is thrilled and beyond proud to be passing down what he started from his back bedroom, aged 35.


        "When I created the business 25 years ago, I never dreamt that Gareth, Sophie and Oliver would all join me one day, let alone enjoy it so much that they would eventually take over. It has been a blessing to see all three of them thrive in their positions and grow into such hard working and respectful professionals. With all their knowledge, ambition and passion, I can already see they're going to take ASL further than I could have ever imagined, and I will be the proudest father watching them. Whilst the actual running of the business is now completely down to Gareth, Sophie & Oliver, I plan on acting as Chairman for the next few years overseeing only the very top level information"\

        **Graham Balshaw, Founder & Chairman**


        “This is a very special milestone for the family and one that myself, Sophie and Oliver are extremely grateful for. I've learnt a lot working alongside my father for 17 years and we share some great memories. One of my fondest memories was travelling to China where we visited suppliers. It was a great trip and really opened my eyes to the opportunities with international business, which we have since developed partnerships all over the world. I'm excited for this new chapter where we plan to double turnover to £10 million"\

        **Gareth Balshaw, Managing Director**


        “It is such a privilege to take on the role of ownership and it is quite an emotional milestone, especially when you look back and see how far we've all come. When we were kids, dad would take us into the factory during the school holidays to help out, and now here we are 20 years later taking over the whole thing! We have a huge amount of respect and admiration for Dad who has built this business from nothing, and grown it so gives us a platform to grow on. I can't wait to continue this journey alongside my brothers and hope we make Dad the proudest father alive"\

        **Sophie Balshaw, Marketing Director**


        “I am incredibly proud of what Dad has created and feel very fortunate to be given this opportunity of ownership alongside Gareth & Sophie. Although taking over the family business during a pandemic may have seemed a strange time, we have made a brilliant start and on track to have a record year. It's a very exciting time in the companies journey and we're ready to push for everything we want to achieve"\
