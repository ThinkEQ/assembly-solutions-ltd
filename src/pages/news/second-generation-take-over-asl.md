        **Celebrating a Special Milestone & New Ownership**


        Founder Graham Balshaw has passed the ownership of Assembly Solutions Ltd down to next generation, his three children; Gareth, Sophie and Oliver.


        After creating the cable assembly assembly business 25 years ago, Father Graham is thrilled and beyond proud to be passing down what he started from his back bedroom in 1995, aged 35.


        **"When I created the business 25 years ago, I never dreamt that Gareth, Sophie and Oliver would all join me one day, let alone enjoy it so much that they would eventually take over. It has been a blessing to see all three of them thrive in their positions and grow into such hard working and respectful professionals. With all their knowledge, ambition and passion, I can already see they're going to take ASL further than I could have ever imagined, and I will be the proudest father watching them".**


        Gareth, Managing Director, reflects on great memories; 


        “This is an incredibly special milestone for the family and one that myself, Sophie and Oliver are extremely grateful for. I've worked alongside my dad for 17 years and made so many great memories with him. My fondest memory is when he took me to Hong Kong for a week visiting exhibitions and suppliers. It was a great trip and really opened my eyes to the opportunities in international business, which since we have developed partnerships in China and Eastern Europe. I'm excited for this new chapter where we plan to double turnover to £10million"


        Sophie, Marketing Director, hopes to make father proud;


        “It feels such a privilege to take on the role of ownership and we are certainly stepping into some very big shoes! Going through this process of taking over the company has been a really special time for us as a family. It's quite an emotional milestone, especially when you look back and see how far we have all come. We started off as kids helping dad out in the school holidays learning all about cables and wires, and here we are 20 years later taking over a £5million business! My dad has taught me so much over the years from mastering marketing techniques to understanding the overall operations of running a business. We plan to make him the proudest father alive”


        Oliver, Purchasing Director, looks forward to next chapter in the business;


        “Electronics has been a part of my life since I was very young, I can still remember Dad teaching me how to wire my first plug when I was about 4 years old! It's because of him that I grew up with a passion for electronics and after going to University to study Electrical Engineering, joining Assembly Solutions was the future path I wanted to take. Taking over the business from dad has been such a great opportunity and one I feel extremely grateful for. He has built an incredible platform for us, and it's now time for us to work the hardest we ever have as there is so much we want to achieve for the business!
