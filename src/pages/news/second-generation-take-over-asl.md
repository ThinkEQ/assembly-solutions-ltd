        **Celebrating New Ownership**\

        \

        Graham Balshaw is proud to have passed the ownership of Assembly Solutions down to his three children; Gareth, Sophie and Oliver Balshaw.


        Since starting the business 25 years ago, Graham is delighted to keep the £5million turnover business in the family.


        **"It has been a privilege to watch my children join the business one by one, over the past 25 years and I couldn’t be more proud. Their work ethic and dedication to growing the business made it a very easy decision in passing the company down to them and I’m looking forward to seeing them take ASL even further".**


        Gareth joined the business in 2002 aged 18 and has worked his way to the top, being appointed Managing Director in 2019.


        “It’s been a privilege to work with my father every day for 17 years! Many people can’t believe in all that time, we have never fallen out or had a single argument. That’s just the respect we have for each other”.


        **My fondest memory with Graham was being taken to Hong Kong for my first business trip aged 22. We had 1 week there visiting exhibitions and meeting suppliers. It was a great trip and opened my eyes to how we could do a lot more international business. Since then we have developed strong partnerships in China and Eastern Europe.**


        We saw a record growth of 30% in 2020 and predicting further growth of 20% for 2021. Our plan for the next 5 years is to double the turnover to £10million by investing in more machinery and venturing into new markets. Whilst we appreciate such growth will come with challenges, we know with focus and hard work it’s achievable”.


        Sophie is the creative Marketing Executive who is proud to share her passion and ambition with her two brothers.


        **“This is by far the biggest highlight and achievement in my life to date. I am so happy and feel extremely humble to be taking over the business with Gareth and Oliver and can't wait to continue this incredible journey with them. It’s quite an emotional milestone when you look back and see how far we have all come. We started off as kids helping dad out in the school holidays, and here we are 20 years later taking over a £5million business!**


        I will definitely miss dad not being around the factory every day, but I'm glad he is now enjoying retirement! He has taught me so much over the years from mastering marketing techniques to understanding the overall operations of running a business. I hope we make him proud”.


        Oliver is the Purchasing Manager and looks forward to next chapter in the business.


        **“Electronics has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. From my Dad teaching me to wire my first plug when I was only 6, to re-wiring my first house! None of which I could have done without him.**


        My journey with ASL has gone from simply buying materials to now managing the purchasing department and managing multiple production cells so it’s really exciting to now be taking over the business that my Dad started from scratch. I can’t wait to see what the future holds and am looking forward to working with my family to make my old man proud!”
