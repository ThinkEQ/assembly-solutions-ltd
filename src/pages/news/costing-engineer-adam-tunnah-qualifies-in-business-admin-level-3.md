        We are celebrating with our Costing Engineer Adam Tunnah after he successfully qualifies in Business Administration Level 3. 


        Adam has been studying for this qualification over the last two years with independent training provider Alliance Learning. 


        Adam commented on his achievement;


        ***"I’ve really enjoyed completing this Qualification and have learnt so much on different areas of Business. I joined Assembly Solutions with no previous office experience, so this has really helped give me the knowledge and confidence as I start to grow and work my way up to a more senior level"***.


        Whilst studying for this qualification Adam has played a significant part in the companies recent record growth of over 20%. As a costing engineer, he has been involved in pricing up some of our biggest contracts to date and has helped to retain existing customers through carrying out detailed costing analysis.
