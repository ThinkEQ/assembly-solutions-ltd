        We set out at the start of the financial year feeling positive, but due
        to the global variables it was difficult to forecast across different
        sectors. The year offered its challenges with supply chain and
        logistical difficulties caused by the Covid pandemic followed on by the
        unrest in Europe due to the conflict in Ukraine. With the year now
        complete, we’re delighted to report on a record £7million turnover and
        to have brought 25 brand new customers on board. I'm exceptionally proud
        of our Sales team who have gone above and beyond to build great
        relationships with customers and give them the best service possible.
        I'm excited for the new year ahead and hope we continue on this journey
        of growth"

    We are celebrating a record financial year after reaching an impressive 20%
    growth on the previous year.


    This record result was driven by our cable assembly manufacturing services which saw 25 new customers come on board. 


    One cable assembly contract we have won this year was from a Magent" that we won over a competitot that was struggling to keep up with their demands and couldn't support theiwould follow once settled in.

    We saw some positive growth in Automotive opportunities this year and were pleased to support a Chassis manufacturer with their urgent need for prototype vehicle wiring harnesses. They made initial contact with us after experiencing long delays on deliveries with their then supplier. We successfully stepped up and won this contract after demonstrating our high quality of product and competitive pricing. Their state of the art vehicles are powered by batteries and comprises 4x individual drive wheels with each chassis comprising 4 identical sets of harnesses. It's been an interesting project to work on and we're looking forward to further opportunities with volumes in the region of 1000’s per month.
