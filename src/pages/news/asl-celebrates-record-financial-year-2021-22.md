        We have drawn our financial year 2021-22 to a close and pleased to share
        record numbers after achieving an impressive 20% growth on the previous
        year.


        This record result was driven by our [cable assembly manufacturing services](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/cable-assembly) which saw 25 new customers come on board. 


        We surprisingly saw some positive growth in Automotive opportunities this year and were delighted to win a contract for [custom cable assemblies](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/cable-assemblies)from an Electric Vehicle Drive Systems manufacturer. This customer approached ASL after they were struggling to keep up with demands and needed additional resource to support their sub-assembly wiring products.


        We were also pleased to support a Chassis manufacturer with their urgent need for prototype vehicle wiring harnesses. They made initial contact with us after experiencing long delays on deliveries with their then current supplier. We successfully stepped up and won this contract after demonstrating our high quality samples and competitive pricing. Their state of the art vehicles are powered by batteries and comprises 4x individual drive wheels with each chassis comprising 4 identical sets of harnesses. It's been an interesting project to work on and we're looking forward to further opportunities with volumes in the region of 1000’s per month.

        I am absolutely delighted we have achieved a financial record year
        2021-22. We have closed the year on £7million sales turnover which is a
        phenomenal growth of 20% on the previous year. It is very much
        recognised throughout the workforce that considering the current
        climate, all our departments have pulled together and delivered an
        exceptional result. The year has definitely come with its challenges of
        supply chain logistical issues and supplier price increases, and with
        this I give credit to how our costing, procurement and sales department
        have managed to keep this under control. I'm excited for the new year
        ahead and hope we continue on this exciting journey of growth.
