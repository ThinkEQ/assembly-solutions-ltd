        Manufacturing was undoubtedly an industry hit hard in 2021. As an
        electrical cable assembly and [wiring harness
        manufacturer](www.assembly-solutions.com/wiring-harness) shipping to
        customers worldwide, we witnessed first hand the supply chain issues and
        delivery disruptions.


        Times were tough and we were tested like never before.


        But remaining positive throughout and In the end we reached an incredible record of £6million turnover, and for that we send thanks to our loyal customers, supportive suppliers and our team - for being absolutely awesome.


        Here's the highlights;


        * Reached Record £6Million Turnover

        * Sales Growth of 25%

        * Invested £100,000 in New Machinery 

        * Launched New Website

        * Achieved ISO 45001 Environmental Accreditation

        * Hired New Quality Manager

        * 4 People Reached 10 Years Service


        Overall it was a year to be extremely proud of, especially after the damaging impact that the pandemic has had on some areas of manufacturing in the UK.


        We have an exciting year ahead working on more [cable assembly](www.assembly-solutions.com/cable-assembly) and [wiring harness projects](www.assembly-solutions.com/wiring-harness) which we look forward to sharing in the coming months.
