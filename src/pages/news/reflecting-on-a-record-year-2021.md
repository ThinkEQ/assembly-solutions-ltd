        **Reflecting On A Record Year 2021**\

        \

        Manufacturing was undoubtedly an Industry hit hard in 2021 where we witnessed first hand the supply chain issues and delivery disruptions that were caused not only in the UK, but overseas too.


        As a cable assembly and [wiring harness manufacturer](www.assembly-solutions.com/wiring-harness) shipping to customers worldwide, there were periods of pressure and we were tested like never before.


        With a surprise surge in demand we experienced 20% growth and had to work closely with our customers and suppliers to keep production moving as smoothly and efficiently as possible. 


        To our delight, 2021 saw Assembly Solutions reach a record of £6million turnover, and for that we thank our customers, supportive suppliers and most importantly our team - for being absolutely awesome.


        **2021 Highlights;**


        * Reached Record £6Million Turnover

        * Sales Growth of 25%

        * Invested £100,000 in New Machinery 

        * Launched New Website

        * Achieved ISO 45001 Environmental Accreditation

        * Hired New Quality Manager

        * 4 People Reached 10 Years Service


        Overall it was a year to be extremely proud of, especially after the damaging impact that the pandemic has had on some areas of manufacturing in the UK.


        We have an exciting year ahead working on more [cable assembly](www.assembly-solutions.com/cable-assembly) and [wiring harness projects](www.assembly-solutions.com/wiring-harness) which we look forward to sharing in the coming months.
