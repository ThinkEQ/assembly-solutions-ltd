        We are proud to be celebrating our 25th Anniversary.


        Since ASL was founded back in 1995 by our Chairman Graham Balshaw, it has been an incredible journey and we’re delighted to have reached this special milestone.


        The last 25 years have seen us evolve into a leading manufacturer with 70 staff and world class customers including Ford, Rolls Royce and Siemens.


        We are so grateful to all our employees, customers and suppliers who have helped us reach this anniversary and we look forward to many more years ahead.


        Starting from humble beginnings, Founder Graham reflects on the journey;

      quote: It has been an incredible 25 years and has been a journey that I look
        back on with great pride. The early years were hard – a lot of long days
        and late nights. I couldn’t have done it without the support of my wife
        Anne who raised our children and helped me get ASL off the ground. The
        team have been fantastic and their loyalty helped ASL make it this far.
        I am also delighted that as we celebrate 25 years in business, we also
        celebrate new ownership after I recently passed the company down to my
        three children, Gareth, Sophie and Oliver. I’m beyond proud to be in a
        position to hand this over to the three of them and look forward to
        seeing them achieve their dreams".
