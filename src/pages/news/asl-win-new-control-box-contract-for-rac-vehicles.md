        **New Deal: £250,000 Control Box Contract**\

        \

        W﻿e are thrilled to share the news that we have have won a staggering quarter of a million pound 12-month contract with RAC vehicles.\

        \

        Production is well underway at our Bolton [ASL](https://www.linkedin.com/company/asl-bolton/) factory and the guys are hard at work to fulfill the high-volume order of 800 control boxes & wiring harness assemblies.\

        \

        This control system we manufacture is used to power the onboard winch that assists in the deployment and vehicle loading, enabling a vehicle to be towed away within 10 minutes of arriving at the scene.\

        \

        An excellent effort from the team so far, especially [Gareth Edwards](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAB1xCsQB4aM-Utvd2j-UTEgPDcro75j94K0), [Phil Beales](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAt9tJYBwFmjFf4RGy6qzGMvpDOzdWJcxBw) & [joao jorge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABdKJlUBunUDdmvsP-CS9Ismce8r0y-zCXg), and great to hear some positive feedback from the customer:\

        \

        “ASL provide state of the art technology and manufacture to an unprecedented quality. They are a pleasure to deal with, always quick to communicate and competitively priced.”\
