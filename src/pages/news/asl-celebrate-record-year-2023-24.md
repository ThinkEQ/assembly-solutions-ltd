        **ASL Celebrate Record Financial Year 2023-24**


        We are overjoyed to announce, ASL have achieved a record-breaking financial year with a remarkable turnover of £8.2 million. This significant achievement is further highlighted by £927,000 of brand-new business secured over the past year, showcasing our strong growth and strategic success.


        Our dedicated team of 90 staff at the Bolton manufacturing facility has set an ambitious target of reaching a £10 million turnover by 2026. To accommodate our growing workforce, we plan to construct a mezzanine within the factory, creating additional office space to support our increasing number of employees.


        In addition to our financial success, we have made substantial investments in infrastructure and our workforce. Recent expenditures include £100,000 on solar panels and £75,000 on a state-of-the-art stock system with two new stock controllers. These investments reflect our commitment to innovation, sustainability, and operational excellence, aiming to enhance efficiency and build customer trust.


        As a family-owned business, managed by siblings Gareth, Sophie, and Oliver Balshaw, we are thrilled with this year's achievements and optimistic about future growth. 


        Gareth Balshaw, our Managing Director, expressed his gratitude: 


        ***"It is an incredible privilege to run the company and work with such a dedicated team. The commitment and passion from all our staff have been key to our success, leading to record order books and sales figures."***


        Our dedication to our employees is evident in the notable milestones achieved by several team members. Over the past year, Rob Parkinson celebrated his 20-year anniversary, incredibly without a day off sick! Michele Barnes also reached a major milestone, celebrating her 10th year of service. 


        We have rightfully recognized and promoted several employees: Adam Tunnah to Costing Supervisor, Adam Walsh to Junior Engineer, Petronela Bordeianu to Team Leader, Madalina Tecucianu to Purchase Ledger, and Melania Rovetto to Production Supervisor.


        We are excited about the future and encourage anyone looking for a production operator role to apply by emailing: [aubrey.oldham@assembly-solutions.com](<>) and [phil.beales@assembly-solutions.com](<>).
