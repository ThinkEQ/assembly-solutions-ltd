        **New Deal: ASL Win Control Panel Project**


        We are delighted to share the news that we have won a new contract to manufacture **50 control panels** for use in **specialist vehicle conversions**.


        Production is flowing in full force at our Bolton factory today, and the collaboration between colleagues has never looked so good. Our skilled operators are hard at work with some demanding delivery dates to hit, but all parts are in and things are moving at a positive pace.


        T﻿his contract comes from a customer who we have been supplying to for over a decade and it's testament to the team that we have built strong long-term partnerships like this with customers.\

        \

        **W﻿hat the control panels are used for:**\

        The [control panels](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/control-panels) manufactured for this project will be used to control secure vehicles that are designed to carry cash and valuables and they control everything on the vehicle regarding the conversion. There is a biometric fingerprint unit that communicates with the panel, so the system knows if the correct person is entering the vehicle. Only the first 1 or 2 crew members that register on the vehicle in the morning can access the vehicle even if another employee tries to access the vehicle. The system regulates entry and exit as well as how many lockers are opened within a given time. The system utilises an HMI screen which allows the crew to control certain aspects of the system, and relays information about the status of the system to the crew in the event of an issue. The crew can then take action to rectify any issues.


        The control system can prevent the vehicle from moving and has different modes that can be controlled by a code exchange mechanism (crew must contact the depot for a code). The system can also be remotely connected for diagnostic purposes and release the side door when the crew lock their ignition key on the vehicle. There are 162 inputs and outputs used on these vehicles, meaning there is 162 switches, sensors, solenoids, siren, LED indicators, chassis control signals (for locking and unlocking, engine stop, throttle control) fitted to the vehicle that this system uses to monitor and control every aspect of the vehicle conversion.


        The control panels have a combined input and output capability of 200 inputs and outputs utilising IO link sensors, which have the ability to measure distances within the sensor detection range, as well as report the state of the sensor to the control system including errors and incorrect adjustment. This data can be used to report issues and defect to a service agent. The control system uses a Human Machine Interface which relays data to the operator allowing them to act when required, or to allow control of certain aspects of the system. All the panels are connected via both EtherCAT and EtherNET with remote accessibility for diagnostic purposes.


        A huge well done to our Production Manager Phil Beales & his team for getting operations efficiently up and running, and also our Technical Manager Damien Walsh whose expertise has been significant to pull this project off successfully.

      quote: We have been a long-standing customer of ASL, with orders being submitted
        every year for the last decade. Our past account managers have always
        been great to deal with, and during our working relationship with ASL,
        several have been promoted, leaving a vacancy to be filled. On such
        person that we have had the pleasure of dealing with is Adam Saoudi who
        is very friendly & helpful and fast in resolving queries. Adam became
        our customer account manager approximately 18 months ago and has been
        great to deal with. He has handled all our quotes and orders from start
        to finish without issue. If he couldn’t return with an answer, he found
        someone within Assembly Solutions who could. He has been extremely
        accommodating with difficult requests that we have had to make, caused
        by current global semiconductor shortages. Adam and ASL, as always, make
        a difficult situation work
