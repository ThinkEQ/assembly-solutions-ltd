        **New Deal: ASL Win Control Panel Project**


        We are delighted to share the news that we have won a new contract to manufacture **50 control panels** for use in **specialist vehicle conversions**.


        Production is flowing in full force at our Bolton factory today, and the collaboration between colleagues has never looked so good. Our skilled operators are hard at work with some demanding delivery dates to hit, but all parts are in and things are moving at a positive pace.


        T﻿his contract comes from a customer who we have been supplying to for over a decade and it's testament to the team that we have built strong long-term partnerships like this with customers.\

        \

        **W﻿hat the control panel capability**\

        The [control panels](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/control-panels) have a combined input and output capability of 200 inputs and outputs utilising IO link sensors, which have the ability to measure distances within the sensor detection range, as well as report the state of the sensor to the control system including errors and incorrect adjustment. This data can be used to report issues and defect to a service agent. The control system uses a Human Machine Interface which relays data to the operator allowing them to act when required, or to allow control of certain aspects of the system. All the panels are connected via both EtherCAT and EtherNET with remote accessibility for diagnostic purposes.


        A huge well done to our Production Manager Phil Beales & his team for getting operations efficiently up and running, and also our Technical Manager Damien Walsh whose expertise has been significant to pull this project off successfully.

      quote: We have been a long-standing customer of ASL, with orders being submitted
        every year for the last decade. Our past account managers have always
        been great to deal with, and during our working relationship with ASL,
        several have been promoted, leaving a vacancy to be filled. On such
        person that we have had the pleasure of dealing with is Adam Saoudi who
        is very friendly & helpful and fast in resolving queries. Adam became
        our customer account manager approximately 18 months ago and has been
        great to deal with. He has handled all our quotes and orders from start
        to finish without issue. If he couldn’t return with an answer, he found
        someone within Assembly Solutions who could. He has been extremely
        accommodating with difficult requests that we have had to make, caused
        by current global semiconductor shortages. Adam and ASL, as always, make
        a difficult situation work
