        **Record Year: ASL surpass £8million sales turnover in 2022-23**


        We are incredibly proud to announce our family Bolton business, ASL, has achieved yet another record-breaking result.


        C﻿losing on our financial year 2022-23, we can confirm a record result that for the first time ever has seen us surpass 8 million pounds sales turnover.\

        \

        It has been a challenging but exciting year that will be difficult to beat! Here’s some highlights:\

        \

        👉 Sales growth from £7M to £8M\

        👉 Workforce grown from 60 to 90\

        👉 Made & delivered over 1 million cables\

        👉 [Robert Parkinson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABuYs6QB_wO4TDcS4iTngW9KqnIFBhBNtac) achieved 20 Years Service\

        👉 [Gareth Edwards](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAB1xCsQB4aM-Utvd2j-UTEgPDcro75j94K0) promoted to Director\

        \

        A shout-out to Team ASL, because you don’t grow by £1 million in 12 months without (excuse my French) a bloody good team. From Sales to Costing, Technical, Engineering, Purchasing, Production and Accounts - you absolutely smashed it, well done guys! 👏\

        \

        We wish to share a huge thank you to all our customers for their continued loyalty. It means so much to have you on our journey.
