        It has been a goal the company has been working towards for a number of years now, so it is with great pride that we share a record milestone of surpassing £5million turnover in our financial year 2020-21.\

        \

        Since closing our financial year on 30th April 2021, we have been celebrating the record year which was made up of a number of highlights;


        * Record £5Million Sales Turnover

        * Biggest ever growth in one year of 20%

        * Awarded biggest ever contract over £700,000

        * Supported NHS with Cable Assemblies for Covid Apparatus

        * Finalists of "Insider Made in North West" Award


        As manufacturers of electrical cable assemblies for medical equipment, we have been busier than ever and proud to be supporting the Medical sector with cable assemblies for Covid testing equipment and other medical equipment including Hospital beds and Ventilation applications.\

      name: Gareth Balshaw, Managing Director
      quote: The company has seen continuous growth year on year, but the start of
        2020 proved the most challenging due to the pandemic. We have been
        fortunate that many companies have required UK manufacture rather than
        overseas during the past 12 months, giving us the opportunity to win
        news contracts. We have taken the opportunity of this growth to invest
        in our people and machinery and I am absolutely delighted to see us
        finish the year with a record 20% growth and £5million turnover. The
        whole team have worked brilliantly throughout the pandemic and really
        pulled together to support the company through it's busiest and
        demanding time ever. We now have a very exciting and ambitious year
        ahead as we push to grow by another 20% and reach a turnover of
        £6million by April 2022.
