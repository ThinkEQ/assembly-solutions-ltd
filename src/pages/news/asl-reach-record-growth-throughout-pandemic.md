        It has been a goal the company has been working towards for a number of years now, so it is with great pride that we share a record milestone of surpassing £5million turnover in our financial year 2020-21.\

        \

        Since closing our financial year on 30th April 2021, we have been celebrating the record year which was made up of a number of highlights;


        * Record £5Million Sales Turnover

        * Biggest ever growth in one year of 20%

        * Awarded biggest ever contract over £700,000

        * Supported NHS with Cable Assemblies for Covid Apparatus

        * Finalists of "Insider Made in North West" Award


        As manufacturers of electrical cable assemblies for medical equipment, we have been busier than ever and proud to be supporting the Medical sector with cable assemblies for Covid testing equipment and other medical equipment including Hospital beds and Ventilation applications.\

      name: Gareth Balshaw, Managing Director
      quote: To achieve what we have in the last 12 months is absolutely incredible,
        and I’m exceptionally proud to see the company reach this record. We
        have always seen growth year on year, but to expand by 20% during a
        period of much uncertainty, is testament to our fantastic team and their
        performance. It's been a pleasant surprise to see an increase in
        opportunity for UK manufacturing and an exciting time for ASL, investing
        in new people and machinery to meet customer demand. We now have a very
        exciting and ambitious year ahead as we push for even further growth and
        reach a turnover of £6million by April 2022.
