        It has been a goal the company has been working towards for a number of
        years now, so it is with great pride that we share a record milestone of
        surpassing £5million turnover in our financial year 2021-22.\

        Since closing our financial year on 30th April 2021, we have been celebrating the record year which was made up of a number of highlights;


        * Record £5million sales turnover

        * Biggest ever growth in one year of 20%

        * Awarded biggest ever contract over £700,000

        * Supported NHS with Cable Assemblies for Covid Apparatus

        * Finalists of "Insider Made in North West" Award


        As manufacturers of electrical cable assemblies for medical equipment, we have been busier than ever and proud to be supporting the Medical sector with cable assemblies for Covid testing equipment and other medical equipment including Hospital beds and Ventilation applications.\
