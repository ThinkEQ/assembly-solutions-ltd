        **New Deal: £250,000 Cable Assembly Contract**


        Our family business, [ASL](https://www.linkedin.com/company/asl-bolton/)A﻿fter months of meetings, costing, quoting and producing sample approvals, we are delighted to have won a new deal worth a quarter of a million pounds, for the Electric Vehicle Industry.


        Production is now well underway and our four operators - Choi, Kathy, Mei Ki & Ruby are leading the manufacturing process with some demanding deliveries to hit.\

        \

        They will make a total of 50,000 cable assemblies - all starting on the high-speed machines for cut, strip & crimp wire preparation, then through to assembly for connector population & fitting heat shrink sleeving.\

        \

        The immaculate & efficient production line in our Bolton factory was set up in record time by our Production Manager Rob Parkinson and it has been an excellent effort by him to train the team whilst also making improvements to production engineering.\

        \

        Also a huge well done to our sales guys who successfully got this off the ground - John Waterworth, [Gareth Edwards](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAB1xCsQB4aM-Utvd2j-UTEgPDcro75j94K0) & [Adam Tunnah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAACiQpNMBHImYfzjOWHxtP1Z_CSgG0-c-3z4)\
