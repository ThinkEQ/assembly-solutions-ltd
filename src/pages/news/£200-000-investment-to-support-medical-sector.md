        **ASL Machinery Investment to support Medical sector**


        The Medical sector has without a doubt never been under this much pressure.


        We have been supplying cable assemblies and wiring looms for medical equipment for over 20 years and have never seen such growth in demand since early this year.


        After coronavirus spread worldwide, we have been pushed by medical equipment manufacturers to improve lead time and drastically increase volumes – something we were not set up for.


        To meet the critical demands, we invested £200,000 in automatic high speed machine to cut, strip and terminate cables. These assemblies are used in hospital beds and general medical equipment including ventilator apparatus and Covid testing apparatus.


        It has been a challenging time but we are proud to be playing our part in supporting Medical manufacturers worldwide, and to have this investment in place to pave a way for future urgent demands.
