        **Stephen Achieves 10 Years Service**


        Today ASL are celebrating Stephen for 10 Years Service!


        Since joining our Bolton family business back in June 2014, Stephen has become a super skilled cable assembly production operator.


        His quality of soldering and attention to detail has earned him extensive credibility throughout the company - so Iâ€™ll not talk about that one time when he picked up the wrong end of the soldering iron! Ouch ðŸ˜…


        This morning we gave an empowering presentation and surprised Stephen to a Â£250 Amazon voucher, box of Kopparberg, and a card signed by everyone.


        We also arranged a Carrs Pasties Ltd lunch with peas & cabbage for all 90 staff, which was absolutely delicious (highly recommend the steak!)


        Thanks to Aubrey, Robert and Aaron for your fantastic speeches and making Stephen feel special, he has done so much for the company and been a key player to some significant customers over the past 10 years.


        We really enjoy days like this, thereâ€™s been a lot of laughs and some happy grateful tears!
