        ##  **Challenges Within the Electrical Industry**


        <!--EndFragment-->


        <!--StartFragment-->


        The last few years have been incredibly challenging for a large majority of the electrical industry and related sectors such as construction, transport and agriculture. Firstly, the pandemic had huge knock-on effects from labour shortages, closing businesses and transportation issues. Additionally, changes to the EU regulations have only contributed to the challenges within the transportation industry. 


        Despite these issues, the electricity industry, particularly the manufacturing and commercial sectors have flourished alongside companies such as Assembly Solutions by adapting their practices and offerings. At Assembly Solutions, we pride ourselves on being resilient and maintaining reliable and fast product turnarounds for our customers.

        ### **Growth of Prefabrication**

        <!--StartFragment-->


        There has been a huge increase in demand for prefabricated electronic components, especially within the construction and electrical industry. By using a tried and tested standardised process that involves assembling products offsite, customers can reduce their costs and lead times significantly. 


        At Assembly Solutions, we’re experts in pre-assembling electrical components and preparing wiring harnesses and cables for our customers. Not only does it help to reduce costs, it promotes less wasted materials and reduces lead times on site. Also, thanks to our efficient factory process, we’re able to create multiple electrical assemblies at the same time to fill large orders within a fast turnaround. 


        We have tried and tested assembly solutions, where we can prefabricate and prepare a variety of different electrical materials and components to meet your specific requirements. Take a look at our [wire preparation](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/wire-preparation) or [cable assembly](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/cable-assembly) pages for more information on premade and prefabricated electrical items.

        ### **The Rise in Electronic Vehicles**


        <!--EndFragment-->


        <!--StartFragment-->


        In 2021 Britons bought more electric cars than in the previous five years combined. The demand for electric vehicles is increasing year on year. With tax incentives and the ban of petrol and diesel car production after 2030, more and more individuals are looking for a more greener mode of transport. 


        With electric car sales increasing, so does the demand for the components to build them. Assembly Solutions are an established supplier of high quality [wiring harnesses](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/wiring-harness) for the EV and Hybrid car industry, working with well known manufacturers like Alexander Davis and Optare. At Assembly Solutions, we are focussed on supplying the [electric vehicle industry](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/electric-vehicle-and-hybrid-vehicle-wiring-harnesses) with quality assured wiring looms at competitive prices so that we can assist with the vehicle industry going greener, sooner.
