      title: ASL Invest £100,000 In New Wire & Cable Cutting Machinery
      text: >-
        We have boosted our plant machinery after investing £100,000 in a brand
        new Schleuniger fully automatic wire cutting & terminating machine.\

        \

        Adding to our fleet of wire & cable assembly machinery, this impressive investment will introduce efficiencies and create an additional 20% capacity to take on more work.\

        \

        Plant investment is an area the company is continually reviewing as part of our ambitious growth plans and we actively encourage staff to put forward ideas of areas to improve and spending suggestions.

      quote: It was our Production Manager Rob Parkinson who identified the need to
        invest in further machinery after our customer demand got so big earlier
        this year that we were running out of resource to promise customers our
        usual lead times. With this machine now up and running, we’re happy and
        confident in turning products around on a fast & flexible lead time. The
        future for even more machinery investment is looking bright as we are
        currently reviewing more opportunities and analysing in detail where we
        can improve efficiencies and become better technically equipped than we
        have ever been
