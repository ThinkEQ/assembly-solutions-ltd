        Yesterday we celebrated Julie for 20 Years at ASL!


        I’m going to start being known for big balloons and party days with the amount of milestones our employees keep achieving! 


        We do work I promise! 


        So Julie started her journey in 2004 as a production operator, and in her words, “the intention was to stay just a couple of months before I found something more local to home in Leigh.”


        But much to our delight, she grew into a professional quality inspector, and stayed with us for 20 years - an incredible achievement that demonstrates not only her loyalty, but her commitment and dedication to grow ASL into an award-winning UK leading cable assembly company.


        This special day also came with some tears, as it was her last and final working day at ASL, before she sets off to enjoy a well-earned retirement.


        We gave her an amazing send-off and it was our pleasure as company owners to gift Julie with a £500 voucher, bottle of champagne, flowers & balloons. We also arranged the Fish & Chips van to serve everyone in the company a delicious chippy lunch!


        The team are going to miss her so much - and Friday’s at 10:30 will not be same when we don’t hear her shout across the factory “Butttties!” 


        Scroll to the end to see Julie on the ASL cable production line 20 years ago!

        I
         think she deserves a big applause, don’t you?
