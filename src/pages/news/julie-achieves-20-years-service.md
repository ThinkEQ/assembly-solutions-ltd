        **Celebrating Julie’s Remarkable 20-Year Career with ASL**


        Yesterday, ASL had the privilege of honoring Julie for an incredible milestone—20 years of dedicated service.


        Julie began her journey with ASL in 2004 as a production operator. Reflecting on her early days, she shared, *“The intention was to stay just a couple of months before I found something more local to home in Leigh.”*


        However, her brief plans evolved into a remarkable two-decade career. Over the years, Julie grew into a highly skilled quality inspector, exemplifying loyalty, commitment, and professionalism. Her invaluable contributions have played a key role in ASL’s success and growth into an award-winning, UK-leading cable assembly company.


        While this celebration was a testament to Julie’s exceptional career, it was also bittersweet, as it marked her final day with ASL. Julie is now retiring to enjoy a well-earned new chapter of life.


        To commemorate the occasion, Julie was presented with a £500 voucher, a bottle of champagne, flowers, and balloons. The entire team also enjoyed a special Fish & Chips lunch arranged in her honor, ensuring a memorable send-off.


        Julie’s presence will be deeply missed by colleagues across the company, and her warmth and humor will leave a lasting impression. Fridays at 10:30 won’t be the same without her signature call of *“Butttties!”*


        Congratulations to Julie on this incredible achievement. We wish her a long and happy retirement filled with new adventures!
