  quote: ASL is without a doubt the best UK manufacturer of wiring looms and
    wiring harnesses. They have been our preferred supplier for 10 years because
    their quality and attention to detail is none other than excellent and they
    deliver when they say they will (which is something my other suppliers don't
    do!). For us we find working with ASL extremely easy, they are always quick
    to respond and support with fast turnaround deliveries when we have urgent
    demands

**Celebrating 10 productive years with Alexander Dennis**

Alexander Dennis is a global leader in the design and manufacture of double deck buses and is the UK’s largest bus and coach manufacturer.

This year we celebrate 10 years since becoming their supplier and what an interesting journey it has been, adapting to the green revolution of electric and hybrid technology!

Over the years we have built a portfolio of products that we manufacture for Alexander Dennis including;

* [Electric Bus Wiring Harnesses](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/electric-vehicle-and-hybrid-vehicle-wiring-harnesses) 
* [Hybrid Bus Wiring Harnesses](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/electric-vehicle-and-hybrid-vehicle-wiring-harnesses) 
* [High Voltage Battery Cables](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/battery-and-hv-cables) 
* [Control Panels](https://www.assembly-solutions.com/control-panels)

In our spacious and bright factory, we manufacture these [wiring harnesses](/wiring-harness) over a built up to 10 meter long technical CAD drawing. Every drawing includes cable lengths and all connectors to ensure nothing is missed. Upon completion every harness is passed through our QA area to be electrically tested, ensure that there are no faults. 

Being in a demanding industry where lead time is vital, especially for VOR's, we have proven to Alexander Dennis that we can deliver a fast and flexible turnaround - which is probably why they continue to buy from us!

During our customer feedback survey in 2020, we were delighted to hear Alexander Dennis comment on our strengths, which were;

**ASL Strengths**
