**Supplying Wire Prep to World Leader Siemens**

Siemens is a world leading engineering & technology company, and is the largest industrial manufacturing company in Europe.

We supply a range of products to Siemens including;

* Small cut, strip and terminate wires  
* Multi-core cable assemblies 
* Wiring looms  

We use automatic machines to produce most of the product range as they keep quality consistent and reduce labour. On a typical run, our machine will cut, strip and terminate 50,000 wires a day!

Quality is absolutely critical for Siemens as these products are being distributed all around the world. With some countries having a much warmer climate, we need to ensure that our [wire preparation](www.assembly-solutions.com/wire-preparation) assemblies are made to withstand the humidity.\
\
Our wire and [cable assemblies](www.assembly-solutions.com/cable-assemblies) go into a range of Siemens applications, but the most common is their high performance Protection Relays.\

During our customer feedback survey in 2020, we were delighted to hear Siemens comment on our strengths, which were;
