title: Brompton Bicycle choose ASL for Wiring Looms and Cable Assemblies
intro: >-
  Brompton Bicycle are the famous UK manufacturer of the Brompton Folding Bike.


  The unique Brompton bike was designed and built in London in 1975 and is still made in London today. Brompton is making over **48,000 bikes per year** and is the UKâ€™s largest bike manufacturer.


  Brompton have been a huge success all over the world and in recent years when their demands started to soar, they needed a wiring loom supplier who could meet their requirements. Keen to keep all manufacturing in the UK and many parts as possible on their bike British, they were looking for a UK wiring loom and cable assembly supplier who was set up to guarantee first class quality and on time deliveries.


  When we were approached by Brompton to supply the cable assembly that powers the bikes dynamo lights, we were flattered and jumped at the chance of helping a UK manufacturer who was also on a journey of growth like ourselves.
