**Celebrating a Successful 20 Year Partnership**

Stanley Security is a manufacturer of CCTV and Access Control systems. 

Stanley is a special customer of ours as we have built a strong and successful 20 year partnership, after first meeting them back in 1997 to discuss their [cable assembly](www.assembly-solutions.com/cable-assembly) products.

The products that we manufacture for their security systems include;

* Small cut and strip wire assemblies 
* Cable Assemblies 
* Coils 

In the early days we only supplied Stanley with Electromagnetic Coils for their access controls, but after exploring their full product range we found new opportunities, which led us to providing a wider variety of [cable assemblies](www.assembly-solutions.com/cable-assemblies).

During our customer feedback survey in 2020, we were delighted to hear Stanley comment on our Strengths, which were;

**Why Stanley choose us;**

* Reliable delivery dates 
* Flexible to help with urgent demands 
* Staff are Superb​
