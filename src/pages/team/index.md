      Graham created Assembly Solutions in 1995 aged 35 after always having a

      father Terry taught him how to wire his first plug aged only  4! Attending
      Manchester University to qualify in Electrical Engineering, Graham went on
      to work for electrical giants Phillips and Triscan before creating ASL.
