  - bio: Graham created Assembly Solutions in 1995 aged 35 after always having the
      passion to build a successful business in electrical assemblies. From a
      very early age, Electronics came natural to Graham and it's not surprising
      after his father Terry taught him how to wire his first plug when he was
      just 4 years old! After studying Electrical Engineering at Manchester
      University, Graham secured a sought after Production Manager position at
      Phillips, and later down the line made the big leap to leave and create
      Assembly Solutions. Graham enjoys cycling & golf, and a challenge at
      chess!
