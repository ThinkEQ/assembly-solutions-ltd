        Everyone’s requirements are different and while we usually produce wires
        and cables in high quantities, we’re more than happy to quote on lower
        quantities. After all, great things come in small packages, right? 


        \

        With wires produced from £0.02p each, we offer competitive quotes for all our customers on a wide variety of products. Our machines support a range of processing options so you can find exactly what you need, including wire marking with hot-stamp or inkjet markers.

        **Wire Preparation Cheaper than Overseas**


        \

        Why import something when you can create it right here in the UK with very little labour input? While you might think you could get a better deal by taking it overseas, actually, we can guarantee we can compete in this area. 


        With our high-quality machines churning out thousands of wires every day, we can keep our prices extremely low as well as guaranteeing you a fast turnaround. When you outsource abroad, you can also expect higher delivery costs and you aren’t always guaranteed the same quality that you can expect from a local manufacturer. Plus, if you have any problems, it’s much more difficult to resolve these when they’re thousands of miles away in a different time zone. 


        As well, because our friendly family-run team are based in the UK, we’re running on the same time as you and there’s no language barrier to contend with – so we’re here when you need us. So, if you’re thinking about subcontracting your wire preparation overseas, why not get a quote from us first?
