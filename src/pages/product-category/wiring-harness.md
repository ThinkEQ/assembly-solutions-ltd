      title: "We are good at being fast and flexible "
      text: >-
        A common question we get asked is, “How fast can you deliver?”, and over
        the years we’ve learnt that the speed of delivery is a very important
        factor to winning work. In this fast paced world that we live in, we
        have adapted our processes and set up our production lines so that we
        can offer the best and most competitive lead time. To answer the
        question, this is hard as it totally depends on the spec so send your
        drawing to enquiry@assembly-solutions.com and we’ll give you a
        turn-around time. It will be between 3-6 weeks from receipt to enquiry
        to delivery of goods.\

        \

        We have special cell areas that we call “Projects” and we keep these cells free for when a quick job comes on that needs urgent attention and fast turnaround. Other cell areas are set up for routine and planned manufacture where customers will have a 6-12 month scheduled order.

      title: Out-sourcing your harnesses will save you money and time
      text: >-
        Whilst we know it can be tempting to keep as much as you can ‘in-house’,
        we find that even if our clients have a robust in-house electrical team,
        many decide to outsource some products when full capacity is reached.
        This choice gives their design and development engineers more time to
        spend concentrating on future products and projects, rather than simply
        manufacturing components. Our technical experts have the knowledge and
        experience at hand to find flexible solutions for our clients to help
        with any wiring harness or wiring loom requirements.\

        \

        We can help you to reduce your wire harness output, improve your wire harness quality and remove your wire harness bottlenecks. As well as working from drawings and bills of materials, we can also reverse engineer from a prototype and work with you to ensure we’re giving you the most competitively priced solution.\

        \

        With an IPC A-620 fully trained technical team, we guarantee low costs and high quality for all your wiring harness requirements. Our expertise and knowledge base in vehicle high voltage and battery technologies ensures we are market leaders within the electrical wiring industry.

      title: Harness Components
      text: Harness components play a vital role when connecting wires and cables. The
        connectors must be good quality and durable enough to function in even
        the harshest of vehicle environments. They also must be able to
        withstand extreme temperature variations, vibrations, water and
        electromagnetic interference and other conditions. We ensure that our
        products can hold their own in these conditions.
