        #### Custom Made Cable Assembly


        All our cable assembly products are custom made and manufactured against customer drawing and specification. We have technical engineering expertise to support and advise of any beneficial technical or cost-effective changes to the cable assembly.


        Every customer and their cable assembly requirement is unique and different to others that we manufacture, as we supply to such a diverse set of Industries. Our sales and engineering team work closely with customers to ensure we fully understand the application and purpose of the assembly. We provide cost-effective quotes, and run sample prototypes prior to full batch production to ensure quality and specification meets customer approval.


        Our customers really are a reflection of our quality and care, which is why we are immensely proud to manufacture cable assemblies for two world-renowned manufacturers, Aston Martin and Brompton Bicycle. These two customers are examples where the opportunities have grown from manufacturing a handful of their cable assembly products, to now producing an extensive range of cost-effective [cable assemblies](/cable-assemblies) and wiring looms to their operational plants.

        #### Cable Assembly Prototype & Production


        For all new cable assembly and cable preparation products, we create a sample prototype. This to ensure it meets customer approval and also helps to avoid any issues that could occur in future build, such as part availability or quality processes.   


        Manufacturing a prototype is a process we carry out for the introduction of all new cable assembly and [cable preparation assemblies](/cable-preparation). It helps to reveal any design flaws that could affect functionality, but also potential problems in the supply chain or manufacturing processes. A sample is good practice to ensure production is streamlined and efficient for the future volume builds.


        Being able to offer the most cost-effective solution, is another reason we carry out a prototype before production, as creating the first one-off helps us fully understand the total cost of production. Some connectors take longer to assemble if they require soldering or specialist skills so prototyping a design allows us to explore ways to speed up production, reduce labour time and reduce costs â€“ for example by using components that are easier and quicker to assemble.
