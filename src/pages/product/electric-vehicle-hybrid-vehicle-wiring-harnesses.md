        We love sharing all the big names that we make wiring looms for, but due
        to NDA’s we can’t disclose this information a lot of the time. However
        one customer that is happy for us to mention them here is Optare, who
        are a manufacturer of electric and hybrid buses. We have a great
        relationship with Optare and supply them with wiring looms, harnesses,
        battery cables and control panels. We have worked with Optare for 20
        years and have helped them over the years especially when vehicles
        started to change to electric and hybrid. 


        For more information on the wiring looms we supply to Optare, see our projects page Optare select UK Wiring Loom Manufacturer ASL


        As the popularity of electric vehicles continues to skyrocket, we offer electrical cable looms for electric road and rail vehicles, including single-decker buses and train door electrical systems.

      title: The real engineering behind lowering customer costs
      text: Our team of costing engineers have spent years building relationships with
        suppliers and working on our production lines, so they know the whole
        process better than anyone. It is their routine to study batch cards,
        analyse where improvements can be made, where costs can be reduced and
        where processes can be more efficient. All of this analysis, experience
        and knowledge, is why ASL is so successful and now known as the
        preferred UK wiring harness supplier for most major manufacturers.
