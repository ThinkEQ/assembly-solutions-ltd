      title: Driving down costs for customers
      text: Our team of costing engineers have spent years building relationships with
        suppliers and working on our production lines, so they know the whole
        process better than anyone. It is their routine to study batch cards,
        analyse where improvements can be made, where costs can be reduced and
        where processes can be more efficient. All of this analysis, experience
        and knowledge, is why ASL is so successful and now known as the
        preferred UK wiring harness supplier for most major manufacturers.

    testimonial:
      quote:  ASL is without a doubt the best UK manufacturer of wiring looms and
        wiring harnesses. They have been our preferred supplier for 10 years
        because their quality and attention to detail is none other than
        excellent, and they deliver when they say they will (which is something
        my other suppliers don’t do!). For us we find working with ASL extremely
        easy, they are always quick to respond and support us with fast
        turnaround deliveries when we have urgent demands.
