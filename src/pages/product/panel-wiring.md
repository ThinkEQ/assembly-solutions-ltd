        ## Panel Wiring FAQs


        ### What is panel wiring?


        Panel wiring is the process of building an electrical control panel – a metal or plastic box which houses electrical components. These components can serve a variety of function, but their core function is to regulate and control the power supply to whichever machine or device they are powering. 


        Electrical panels must be put together by experienced professionals, who are able to build circuits from diagrams, understand the required safety measures, and are able to wire the panels to the required specifications. 


        ### What is a panel wirer?


        A panel wirer is somebody who arranges and connects electrical components such as switches and cables into functioning control panels. A panel wirer must be able to read and understand electrical diagrams, in order to create panels to the correct specifications. Panel wirers typically work in manufacturing, but can specialise in a range of different systems, including automotive control panels.


        ### What are panel wiring regulations?


        Panel wiring must meet the IPC/WHMA-A-620 standards, which details the correct practices and procedures for cable, wire, and harness assemblies. The IPC/WHMA-A-620 standards cover the required materials, methods and quality tests which should be used to ensure that panel wiring is done to an acceptable calibre.
