        what you need. At ASL, our panel build production operators have
        experience in wiring a huge range of panel assembly. Because we’re a
        bendy bunch, we’re also incredibly flexible with the volume of orders
        that we can fulfil, whether you’re looking for high volume or something
        a little smaller; we will ensure you get your order when you need it. 


        OurIPC A-620 fully trained technical teamhave worked with a wide range of industries including, automotive, nuclear, security and utilities.


        The magic takes place in our UK based factory in Bolton, which is set up as a full-service panel wiring manufacturer in order to save you money on your panels and sub-assemblies with a fast turnaround and competitively priced products.
