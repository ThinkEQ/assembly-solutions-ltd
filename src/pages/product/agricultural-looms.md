        Working in the Agricultural trade is busy, fast-paced and there’s very
        little room for error. That’s why you need a manufacturer you can rely
        on to get you the wiring loom you need at the right price with a fast
        turnaround.

      title: What our customers think
      text: >-
        While you can choose to outsource your manufacturing requirements
        abroad, you’re much more likely to face difficulties in the form of
        language barriers, differing time zones, lower quality products and
        longer turnaround times. Having worked with some major clients,
        including Canberra, Brompton Bicycle, United Utilities and Optare, we
        have consistently demonstrated the value that we can add to our
        clients. 


        With ASL, you can rest assured that you will only ever receive high- quality products that have been tested by our exceptional quality testing team. As well, with a sole factory in the North of England, we can guarantee fast turnaround times and we will be around when you need us.
