      title: Fast & Flexible Lead Times
      text: >-
        In this fast paced world that we live in, we have adapted our [wiring
        loom](/wiring-loom) processes and set up our production lines so that we
        can offer a fast and competitive lead time. Whilst we know it can be
        tempting to keep wiring looms ‘in-house’, we find many customers
        out-source these items to give their design and development engineers
        more time to spend on future projects and products.
