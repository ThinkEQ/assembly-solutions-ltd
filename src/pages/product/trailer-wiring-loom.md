      title: Fast & Flexible Lead Times
      text: >-
        In this fast paced world that we live in, we have adapted our processes
        and set up our production lines so that we can offer a fast and
        competitive lead time.


        Whilst we know it can be tempting to keep wiring looms ‘in-house’, we find many customers out-source these items to give their design and development engineers more time to spend on future projects and products.

      text: >-
        Quality is crucial for all our wiring looms. We deliver into industries
        including Automotive and Agriculture so we have to take extra care
        ensuring that the looms will be robust enough and perform reliably when
        out on the roads.


        All our wiring looms are 100% electrically tested and all our production processes conform to Quality ISO 9001. Our technical experts have the knowledge and experience at hand to find flexible solutions for any wiring loom or harness requirement.

    testimonial:
      quote: ASL is without a doubt the best UK manufacturer of wiring looms and
        wiring harnesses. They have been our preferred supplier for 10 years
        because their quality and attention to detail is none other than
        excellent, and they deliver when they say they will - which is something
        my other suppliers don’t do! For us we find working with ASL extremely
        easy, they are always quick to respond and support us with fast
        turnaround deliveries when we have urgent demands.
