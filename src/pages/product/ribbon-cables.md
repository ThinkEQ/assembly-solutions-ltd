        No matter what type of ribbon cable you require, we’ve seen it all.
        We’ve been at this for a long time and our IPC A-620 ribbon cable
        assembly operators are more than experienced to design and develop a
        quality product that meets your requirements. 


        Having recently invested £100k in our wire and cable preparation machinery, we are the UK leader when it comes to quality products on a fast turnaround.

        While you may choose to outsource your ribbon cable manufacturing
        requirements abroad, we’d argue it might not prove as cost-effective as
        you think. Not only could you be subject to a slower turnaround and
        higher delivery costs, but you may also be buying a lower quality
        product. On top of this, if there are any problems, there’s a potential
        language barrier and different time zones to contend with. 


        With our office based in the North of England, we can assure competitive prices, a fast turnaround and an exceptional level of service.


        **We also offer:** 


        * Battery cables 

        * Braided cables 

        * Cable Assemblies 

        * Ventilator cables
