      title: What our customers think
      text: >-
        One of our long-standing customers for electrical control panels is the
        nuclear giant, Canberra UK, who we supply with highly technical nuclear
        instrumentation panels and assemblies.


        When Canberra identified a problem with their offshore supplier for cable assemblies and control panels, their own quality began to quickly decline. That’s where we came in. 


        To find out more about the type of offering we provide to Canberra, why not take a look at our case study below?
