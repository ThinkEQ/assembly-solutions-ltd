      title: Stay grounded with the right earth strap manufacturer
      text: >-
        Finding the right manufacturer for your requirements is essential, but
        that doesn’t mean that it’s always easy. While at a glance, it may seem
        cheaper to outsource your order abroad, this is often not the case and
        you may find that you fall victim to lower-quality products and a slow
        turnaround.  And another thing…when you need to get through to someone
        on the phone, if there’s a time difference this isn’t always feasible
        and there could be language barriers to contend with once you do get
        through. At ASL, we’re based in an award-winning factory in the UK, with
        the staff and facilities handy to produce top-quality earth straps at a
        competitive price and with a fast turnaround. 


        We can help your business to lower your costs and improve your quality, while ensuring that our fast delivery is consistent and reliable. 


        **Braided cables**


        Whether it’s an earth strap or earth lead, we can produce any type of braided cable assembly. Our custom-made braided earth leads are used for earthing and electrical bonding applications.


        All our braided assemblies are made in our UK Bolton factory and our experienced staff work hard to ensure that every product reaches our extremely high standards of quality. 


        By selecting the correct braid, termination and insulation, our earthing straps are optimised for each application. No matter the size of your order, we ensure that every single strap reaches the required performance criteria with respect to temperature, flexibility, corrosion resistance, weight and electrical characteristics.


        **We offer:** 


        * Braided Earth Leads

        * Braided Earth Straps

        * Braided Earth Cables
