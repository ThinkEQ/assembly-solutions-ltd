        ## Earth Strap FAQs


        ### What is an earth strap in the automotive industry?


        An earth strap is a lead which runs between an electrical component and a negative battery terminal, or chassis, providing an alternate path for electricity to travel. The earth strap protects your vehicle from damage in the event of a power surge or short circuit, by dispersing the electricity safely.


        ### Why are earth straps braided?


        Earth straps are braided in order to protect both people, and electrical devices, from sudden surges in electricity. Normally made from high-grade copper wire, earth straps can redirect electricity safely into the earth, or a negative battery terminal when used within the automotive industry. 


        The braided wire is better able to transmit electricity safely than a single wire, due to splitting the electricity between multiple wires.
