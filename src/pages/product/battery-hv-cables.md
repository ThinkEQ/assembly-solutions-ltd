        ## Battery & HV Cable FAQs


        ### What is a high voltage cable?


        A high voltage cable is an electrical cable, capable of transmitting power at a high voltage. Any cable that is designed to transmit over 1000 volts between two points, and can do so safely, can be described as a high-voltage cable. 


        ### What’s the difference between a high voltage and low voltage cable?


        A high voltage cable (also referred to as an HV cable) is an electrical cable which can transmit power at a rate of 1000V (1kV), or higher. A low voltage cable is a cable which is only capable of safely transmitting up to 50V of electricity.


        High-voltage cables are used to power large, high-output machines, such as those commonly seen in factories. Low voltage cables are more suited for residential, low-power use. For instance, in low-voltage household appliances. 


        ### How many volts is a high voltage cable?


        A high voltage cable can safely transmit electricity at a rate of 1000V (1kV), or above. However, there are ultra-high voltage cables which are designed to carry 50,000V (50kV) of energy between two points.


        Before working with any high-voltage cable, it’s vital to always check the specifications of the cable you are using to make sure they are safe and suitable for the job at hand. 


        ### What type of cable is used for batteries?


        To connect a power source such as a car battery to components like headlights or the vehicle ignition, you need specialised cables known as battery cables. Battery cables tend to be fairly rigid, with thick insulated jackets to protect the copper core of the cable.


        ### What size cable do I need for my battery?


        The size of cable you will need to connect a battery will depend on the battery power of the device or machine. It’s best practice to get a cable with a slightly higher voltage than you need, for safety and efficiency reasons. 


        You should also consider how flexible you need the cable to be, as well as any other specifications you require for the task at hand.
