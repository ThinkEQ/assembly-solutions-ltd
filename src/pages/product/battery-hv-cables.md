        Our staff are dedicated to making hundreds of custom battery cables
        daily. So, we ask you to come and virtually visit our world-class
        factory where we can give you exactly what you need. Our in-house
        technical experts give us the best opportunity to get it right first
        time; reducing your costs, removing your bottlenecks and improving your
        quality. To ensure high quality, we have bespoke calibrated pull-off
        measurement capabilities to guarantee top performance.


        This isn’t our first rodeo. We’ve been manufacturing battery and power cables here in the UK for over 20 years and can provide a wide range of terminations from simple ring terminals to more complex lugs and fittings. But hey, don’t take our word for it, ask one of the engineering companies we manufacture for including, Automotive, Nuclear and Utility Industry.


        As all our cable assembly operators are fully qualified to IPC A-620, you can expect the highest level of quality, alongside the level of service you would expect from a family-run business.
