        ## Custom Cable Assembly FAQs


        ### What is a cable assembly?


        A cable assembly is a group of wires, which are bound together into a single unit. The individual wires are measured, then encased in a safe tube made of a non-conductive material such as rubber or polyurethane. Connectors are attached at each end, so that each of the wires can be connected simultaneously to two points, as a single, easy-to-manage cable. 


        ### What is a custom cable assembly?


        A custom cable assembly is a cable assembly made with a specific machine or piece of electrical equipment in mind. Rather than purchasing a pre-assembled cable, a custom cable assembly allows the buyer to make their specifications known prior to manufacture, so that the cable will be the ideal length, and have all the features required for its intended purpose. 


        ### What are the benefits of a custom cable assembly?


        A custom cable assembly can be a great option for your business, particularly if you operate specialist machinery, or manufacture electrical equipment. A custom cable assembly gives you full control over:


        * The length of the wires and final cable assembly;

        * The materials used;

        * The type of connectors used;

        * How much voltage the cable can transmit


        By employing a custom cable assembly service, you get the benefit of their expertise, and can work collaboratively to create the most effective cable for the task at hand.
