      So, what makes ASL different from any other cable assembly manufacturers?

      For a start, we’ve been supplying cable assemblies into the UK market for over 20 years and have worked in the automotive industry for over 10. This has given us a deep understanding of how it works and the challenges that it faces. To remain ahead of the game, all our staff go through annual training with the aim to reduce costs and lead times, as well as retaining our high level of quality.

      As well as having recently been awarded a contract from UK Bus Manufacturer Optare, our cable assembly solutions were a part of their contract for the Greater Manchester Transport Authority who required 66 Hybrid Buses. 
      
      Optare managed to successfully secure the £13million order; the biggest order for hybrid buses placed in the UK so far.
