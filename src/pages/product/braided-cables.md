        When you buy your braided cables through ASL, you can be confident that
        you are investing in a high-quality product. Why? Because as well as
        being an award-winning manufacturer, we work hard to build relationships
        with our clients in order to get to grips with exactly what you need,
        the volume in which you need it and when you need it by. As a family-run
        business, we’re proud of what we do and truly care that everything we
        produce is up to the highest of standards. 


        With our large stock holding, we can manufacture your braided cable assembly within days while still maintaining the level of quality we’ve worked hard at achieving and maintaining. Whether you’re looking for Braided Earth Cables, Braided Earth Leads or Braided Earth Straps, we can help. 


        **Braided Cable Assembly**


        Braided cables are manufactured in a wide variety of volumes. Our flexible set up allows us to help any customer who approaches us with a braided cable enquiry, no matter the size of your order. We offer all our clients a full consultation on your requirements, as well as ongoing support after you’ve received your order.


        **Discover what sets ASL apart**


        Operating from one factory in the North of England, we have complete control over the quality and turnaround of our products. Unlike when you outsource your manufacturer from abroad, with us you can rest assured that you will receive your product when you need it, to the level of quality that you expect. Having over 20 years’ experience in the manufacturing industry, we serve a wide range of sectors, including automotive, nuclear and utilities. 


        Our staff all undertake annual training with the aim to reduce costs and lead times as well as retaining our high level of quality.
