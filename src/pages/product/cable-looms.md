      title: This is excellence in Cable Loom Manufacture
      text: >-
        Look, we know that when it comes to your cable loom manufacturer, you
        expect great service, an even better product and a quick turnaround.
        It’s pretty simple really, yet so many businesses tend to get this wrong
        time and time again. At ASL, we pride ourselves on getting it right,
        each and every time. 


        To ensure quality, we make sure that each and every one of our technical staff is IPC A-620 trained and our quality department check everything before it goes out to you. 


        To ensure a great service, our friendly family-run business focuses on building long-term relationships with our clients, rather than just selling a product then washing our hands of you.


        Finally, to ensure a fast turnaround – we manufacture all of our products in our sole factory in the North East. 


        Convinced yet? Why not take a virtual tour of our award-winning factory to see where this all takes place: 


        **UK Low-Cost Cable Looms and Wiring Looms**


        Unlike many other manufactures, we offer 100% free design and development of cable loom to ensure they’re right for you. We can also arrange a full equipment build service of control panels and box build as part of our wiring harness packages to suit your business.

        communication is excellent from the drawing-up of a new loom to our
        exact needs. Whether a short or high volume requested the prices have
        been good and have helped save many man-hours for us with a fast
        turn-around from order placement.”
