    testimonial:
      quote: ASL is without a doubt the best UK manufacturer of wiring looms and
        wiring harnesses. They have been our preferred supplier for 10 years
        because their quality and attention to detail is none other than
        excellent, and they deliver when they say they will - which is something
        my other suppliers don’t do! For us we find working with ASL extremely
        easy, they are always quick to respond and support us with fast
        turnaround deliveries when we have urgent demands.
