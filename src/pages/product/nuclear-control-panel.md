      title: UK Nuclear Control Panel Manufacture
      text: >-
        We have built specialist expertise in control panel manufacture after
        partnering with companies in the Nuclear Industry.


        We started to work in the Nuclear industry 10 years ago and since then have built a wealth of knowledge and experience on more complex and technical control panels and cable assemblies.


        As an approved supplier to Sellafield, we consider ourselves the preferred and trusted UK manufacturer for nuclear electrical control panel equipment.


        #### Quality Critical Control Panels


        By working with the Nuclear industry, we have proved to ourselves and our customers that we can build to the most complex of [control panels](www.assembly-solutions.com/control-panels) and meet almost any unique specification.


        We understand quality is critical and because of this we take extra care to produce control panels that are 100% reliable under the conditions.

        The [control panels](www.assembly-solutions.com/control-panels) we
        manufacture are used in Nuclear power stations and as part of particle
        detection monitoring apparatus. Due to the nature of such safety
        critical products, we have built special cells within our factory where
        these panels are produced.
