        **Wiring looms made to reduce your costs and improve your delivery
        time** 


        Welcome to ASL and our wiring loom division, where we hope to show how we can help you with your wiring loom and harness requirements.


        We have been making wiring looms for 25 years, so we have a lot to tell you about! In all that time we have made looms for Aston Martin, Siemens and Brompton Bicycle. It’s been exciting working with these companies over the years, but just so you know, the big names, doesn’t mean big prices. Our Bolton based factory has been recently renovated, to make production lines leaner and that the efficiency of this is well reflected in the prices that we give you.


        Based in the North of England, our Bolton bustling factory covers 32,000sqft, with each manufacturing cell designed to efficiently produce wiring looms at the lowest cost and the fastest turn around.
