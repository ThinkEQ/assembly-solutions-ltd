        For us to build the right panel for you, our first priority is to
        understand exactly what you need. By working together with our clients,
        we first build up a picture of your requirements because without this
        set in stone – the rest of the work is doomed to fail. That’s why we
        champion working with a UK manufacturer when it comes to your panel
        build. We will be right there when you need us from the beginning to the
        end, with no issues of working in different time zones or language
        barriers to contend with. We can also guarantee a fast turnaround and a
        high-quality product each and every time. 


        Once we’ve got to grips with what you want, we will then start the design and development of your product. The best part is this stage is 100% free. We also complete rigorous testing to ensure your product is fit for use before it gets sent out. This is done using our automatic testing facilities or with bespoke test equipment designed specifically for the individual product.

        One of our long-standing customers for electrical control panels is the
        nuclear giant, Canberra UK, who we supply with highly technical nuclear
        instrumentation panels and assemblies.


        When Canberra identified a problem with their offshore supplier for cable assemblies and control panels, their own quality began to quickly decline. That’s where we came in.
