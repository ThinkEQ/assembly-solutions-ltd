        Team up with a UK motorsport manufacturer that you can trust. 


        The motorsports industry is fast-paced, exhilarating and competitive; rather like our prices. At ASL, we have the experience and technical expertise required to design and manufacture the highest quality motorsport harnesses. We know that you often need products with a short lead time and at a low-cost and we can guarantee that our dedicated team can make that happen. 


        In our UK-based factory, we can manufacture motorsport wiring loom and wiring harnesses to your exact specifications. Alternatively, we can utilise our experience and work with you to design a product that offers a cost-effective solution.


        **We’re mad about racing**


        We love sport here at ASL but we really love this feedback from our customer Brompton “ASL’s fast turnaround, excellent service, quality and customer focus is superb, and with them always looking to grow as a business, it makes my role as a buyer much easier.”


        **Motorsport Wiring Harness Manufacturer**


        Our team know that the requirements of an F1 racer will likely look very different from those of a club racer which is why we ensure to find out exactly what you need before we get going.

      text: >-
        Having worked with some major clients, including Canberra, Brompton
        Bicycle, United Utilities and Optare, we have consistently demonstrated
        the value that we can add to our clients. While you can choose to
        outsource your manufacturing requirements abroad, you’re much more
        likely to face difficulties in the form of language barriers, differing
        time zones, lower quality products and longer turnaround times. 


        With ASL, you can rest assured that you will only ever receive high-quality products that have been tested by our exceptional quality testing team. As well, with a sole factory in the North of England, we can guarantee fast turnaround times and we will be around when you need us.
