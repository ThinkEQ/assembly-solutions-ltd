        ## Cable Preparation FAQ


        ### What is Cable Preparation?


        Cable preparation is the steps taken to ensure a cable is ready to have a connector attached. Proper cable preparation will ensure that your cables and connectors are safety-compliant, and allow for the smooth transfer of both analogue and digital information signals.


        ### How do I prepare a cable before adding connectors?


        1. Measure and cut your cable to the correct length

        2. Mark on the jacket where you will cut the cable

        3. Cut along both sides of the jacket

        4. Slice the jacket between wires along the dotted lines

        5. Strip the end of each wire

        6. Arrange the ends of wires to fit into the connector

        7. Terminate the wire, by soldering or crimping

        8. Add additional sealing to the interface between the wire and the connector if required

        9. Close the clamshell and tighten hardware
