        While wires and cables can be produced quickly, cheaply and in large
        quantities, we needed to make sure that we got the grounding right
        first. The cable manufacturing and preparation process has a strong
        history where decades of really intelligent people have honed each stage
        of the process and by doing everything that we can to maintain their
        standards, we maintain best practice in every product we create. 


        Want to know how we do it? Well, firstly we make sure that every one of our IPC A-620 trained manufacturing technicians has the know-how required to create and test these products, alongside the integrity to want to maintain our exceptionally high standards. Fancy taking a look around our award-winning factory to see where the magic happens?
