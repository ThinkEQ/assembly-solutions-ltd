        # **Agricultural Wiring Looms and Cable Assemblies**


        Assembly Solutions are a UK manufacturer of Agricultural Wiring Looms and Cable Assemblies.


        From rugged harness designs through to simple earth bonding straps, Agricultural [wiring harnesses](www.assembly-solutions.com/wiring-harness) require specialist manufacturers who appreciate the harsh and hazardous environments that this type of assembly will be expected to perform within, including flexing, moisture, humidity, UV, temperature, chemical etc.


        From prototyping, pre-production through to volume production, ASL are ideally suited as we are able to draw on our knowledge and experience from working with our agricultural OEM, VAR customers, and including automotive, passenger, emergency, construction & transportation sectors.


        Quality, Reliability and durability should always be key considerations due to the exposed nature and inaccessible locations agricultural equipment operates within. Compromising may come at a cost but our engineers are well placed to ensure that you get the best support and advice along with our comprehensive inspection and testing regime for peace of mind.
